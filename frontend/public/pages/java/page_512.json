The player is initially presented with a grid of undifferentiated squares. Some randomly selected squares, unknown to the player, are designated to contain mines. The game is played by revealing squares of the grid by clicking them with a mouse. If a square containing a mine is revealed, the player loses the game. Otherwise, a digit is revealed in the square, indicating the number of adjacent squares that contain mines. The game is won when all mine-free squares are revealed, meaning that all mines have been located.","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437244},{"name":"ngokchau/BinarySearchTree","owner":"ngokchau","html_url":"https://github.com/ngokchau/BinarySearchTree","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"CSE373 HW3","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437293},{"name":"XiSmartElf/Software-System-Security","owner":"XiSmartElf","html_url":"https://github.com/XiSmartElf/Software-System-Security","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Lecture notes","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437300},{"name":"bhks/controlpanel","owner":"bhks","html_url":"https://github.com/bhks/controlpanel","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"alljoyn/services/controlpanel","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437315},{"name":"wardnw/Feb9","owner":"wardnw","html_url":"https://github.com/wardnw/Feb9","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"feb9 ITC115","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437319},{"name":"wardnw/HW4","owner":"wardnw","html_url":"https://github.com/wardnw/HW4","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"ITC115 HW4","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437320},{"name":"mashuaihh/FileProcess","owner":"mashuaihh","html_url":"https://github.com/mashuaihh/FileProcess","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Tools for processing files","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437343},{"name":"boruil/Navigation_Accelerometer","owner":"boruil","html_url":"https://github.com/boruil/Navigation_Accelerometer","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A Glass app that tell the user the current coordinates through Accelerometer","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437363},{"name":"koek67/java-shell","owner":"koek67","html_url":"https://github.com/koek67/java-shell","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A shell environment for Java","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437371},{"name":"koek67/rotating-shapes","owner":"koek67","html_url":"https://github.com/koek67/rotating-shapes","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A simple java graphic with rotating shapes","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437372},{"name":"ginoclement/quizdroid","owner":"ginoclement","html_url":"https://github.com/ginoclement/quizdroid","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"INFO498 HW6-8","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437381},{"name":"dantiston/machineLearningTools","owner":"dantiston","html_url":"https://github.com/dantiston/machineLearningTools","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"machineLearningTools is a java Machine Learning library that provides data structures, functions, and utilities to bootstrap Machine Learning Algorithm development","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437385},{"name":"prasadpande1990/Natural-Language-Processing-","owner":"prasadpande1990","html_url":"https://github.com/prasadpande1990/Natural-Language-Processing-","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Projects and Programs on Natural Language Processing","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437399},{"name":"chengzh2008/MongoDB_online_course","owner":"chengzh2008","html_url":"https://github.com/chengzh2008/MongoDB_online_course","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437409},{"name":"hongshien/BlockWorldAI","owner":"hongshien","html_url":"https://github.com/hongshien/BlockWorldAI","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Forward chaining to find the shortest path to solve a block world problem similar to Tower of Hanoi","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437411},{"name":"NRWB/CanvasEditor","owner":"NRWB","html_url":"https://github.com/NRWB/CanvasEditor","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Help in parsing files","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437412},{"name":"tomasro27/Myo-Personal-Trainer","owner":"tomasro27","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasro27/Myo-Personal-Trainer","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Myo Personal Trainer App","topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437420},{"name":"PrecociouslyDigital/Generator","owner":"PrecociouslyDigital","html_url":"https://github.com/PrecociouslyDigital/Generator","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1815,"global_rank":437432},{"name":"noni-mizu/Calculator","owner":"noni-mizu","html_url":"https://github.com/noni-mizu/Calculator","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Android app: calculator 1 screen app that performs arithmetic math.
