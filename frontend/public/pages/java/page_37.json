It is an android application to record, create and view signals from sound waves and electromagnetic waves (special preamplifier and antenna required). It also has the capability for signal synthesis and analysis.  APRAD was developed at the College of Engineering and Applied Science under the direction of Prof. Mark Golkowski. The development was supported by the National Science Foundation under CAREER grant AGS 1254365. APRAD is intended to be used as an educational and outreach tool as well as very low frequency radio surveying tool.
