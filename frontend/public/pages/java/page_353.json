This assignment took a little bit of trial and error. The first few times I ran my code I noticed a few runtimes seemed to be much higher than it should have been. I ran through my algorithms line by line and eliminated a few loops and lines of code that caused an extra N to the runtime. Upon adjusting my code, I found my runtimes all were more consistent, and much closer to the average runtime.
