The player is initially presented with a grid of undifferentiated squares. Some randomly selected squares, unknown to the player, are designated to contain mines. The game is played by revealing squares of the grid by clicking them with a mouse. If a square containing a mine is revealed, the player loses the game. Otherwise, a digit is revealed in the square, indicating the number of adjacent squares that contain mines. The game is won when all mine-free squares are revealed, meaning that all mines have been located.","topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"pradeepananth/NaiveBayes-Classifier","owner":"pradeepananth","html_url":"https://github.com/pradeepananth/NaiveBayes-Classifier","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Naive Bayes Classifier using Java","topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"al-chen/network","owner":"al-chen","html_url":"https://github.com/al-chen/network","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"al-chen/image-manipulation","owner":"al-chen","html_url":"https://github.com/al-chen/image-manipulation","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"wardnw/HW5","owner":"wardnw","html_url":"https://github.com/wardnw/HW5","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"ITC 115 HW5","topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"wardnw/Quiz3","owner":"wardnw","html_url":"https://github.com/wardnw/Quiz3","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"ITC 115 Quiz 3","topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"wardnw/Feb9","owner":"wardnw","html_url":"https://github.com/wardnw/Feb9","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"feb9 ITC115","topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"Shobhit1/FileClientServerApp","owner":"Shobhit1","html_url":"https://github.com/Shobhit1/FileClientServerApp","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"Shobhit1/BarrelRaceGame","owner":"Shobhit1","html_url":"https://github.com/Shobhit1/BarrelRaceGame","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"Shobhit1/ContactManager","owner":"Shobhit1","html_url":"https://github.com/Shobhit1/ContactManager","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"mashuaihh/FileProcess","owner":"mashuaihh","html_url":"https://github.com/mashuaihh/FileProcess","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Tools for processing files","topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"ruiwen-zhao/SparkTest","owner":"ruiwen-zhao","html_url":"https://github.com/ruiwen-zhao/SparkTest","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Dealing big-data from HBase with Spark, using Java","topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"ruiwen-zhao/myFirstAndroidApp","owner":"ruiwen-zhao","html_url":"https://github.com/ruiwen-zhao/myFirstAndroidApp","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"koek67/octo-minesweep","owner":"koek67","html_url":"https://github.com/koek67/octo-minesweep","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A simple Minesweeper game","topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"koek67/java-shell","owner":"koek67","html_url":"https://github.com/koek67/java-shell","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A shell environment for Java","topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"koek67/rotating-shapes","owner":"koek67","html_url":"https://github.com/koek67/rotating-shapes","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A simple java graphic with rotating shapes","topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"factoidforrest/homepage","owner":"factoidforrest","html_url":"https://github.com/factoidforrest/homepage","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"prasadpande1990/Natural-Language-Processing-","owner":"prasadpande1990","html_url":"https://github.com/prasadpande1990/Natural-Language-Processing-","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Projects and Programs on Natural Language Processing","topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"tomasro27/Myo-Personal-Trainer","owner":"tomasro27","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasro27/Myo-Personal-Trainer","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Myo Personal Trainer App","topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"saryana/ReverseAlarm","owner":"saryana","html_url":"https://github.com/saryana/ReverseAlarm","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Based on your sleep cycles it will tell you what time to go to bed.","topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"PrecociouslyDigital/Generator","owner":"PrecociouslyDigital","html_url":"https://github.com/PrecociouslyDigital/Generator","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1816},{"name":"noni-mizu/Calculator","owner":"noni-mizu","html_url":"https://github.com/noni-mizu/Calculator","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Android app: calculator 1 screen app that performs arithmetic math.
