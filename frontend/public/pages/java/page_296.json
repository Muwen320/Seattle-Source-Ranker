Originally, ad-hoc OLAP queries, when expressed in standard SQL lead to very complex relational algebraic expressions, which in turn leads to inefficient optimization and hence poor performance.  The query processing engine takes Extended-SQL queries as input and processes them to generate a java file. The java file thus generated produces the output of the query from the database.
