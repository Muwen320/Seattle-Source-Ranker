(2) Display the map in ascending order by course name, showing each course name and its enrollment count. Note: You cannot directly increment the enrollment count in a map entry. Instead, retrieve the existing count using the get() method, add 1 to the count, and then insert the key and updated enrollment count back into the map by calling the put() method.","topics":[],"score":2091,"global_rank":310325},{"name":"JosiahGr/hello-world","owner":"JosiahGr","html_url":"https://github.com/JosiahGr/hello-world","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2091,"global_rank":310336},{"name":"RameezAijaz/DataStructures-Algorithms","owner":"RameezAijaz","html_url":"https://github.com/RameezAijaz/DataStructures-Algorithms","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Java Implementation of DataStructures and Algorithms","topics":[],"score":2091,"global_rank":310337},{"name":"chris-mitchell/PetList","owner":"chris-mitchell","html_url":"https://github.com/chris-mitchell/PetList","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2091,"global_rank":310342},{"name":"tboulevard/AndroidAssociateDeveloper2018","owner":"tboulevard","html_url":"https://github.com/tboulevard/AndroidAssociateDeveloper2018","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Application that implements most content on the Android Associate Developer Exam","topics":[],"score":2091,"global_rank":310347},{"name":"akhildn/TASI_report","owner":"akhildn","html_url":"https://github.com/akhildn/TASI_report","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2091,"global_rank":310354},{"name":"aditya-chayapathy/content-based-recommender","owner":"aditya-chayapathy","html_url":"https://github.com/aditya-chayapathy/content-based-recommender","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":["angularjs","css","h2-database","html","java","javascript","lucene","recommendation-system","spring","web-crawler"],"score":2091,"global_rank":310360},{"name":"kenneth-id/COMP3111-JavaWebscraper","owner":"kenneth-id","html_url":"https://github.com/kenneth-id/COMP3111-JavaWebscraper","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Java Webscraper for COMP3111 course in HKUST","topics":[],"score":2091,"global_rank":310363},{"name":"therealAJ/dsl-charts","owner":"therealAJ","html_url":"https://github.com/therealAJ/dsl-charts","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Java","description":"CPSC 410 Project for creating chart visualizations using a domain-specific-language","topics":[],"score":2091,"global_rank":310377},{"name":"Williamsja0314/edureka-sample-spring-microservices","owner":"Williamsja0314","html_url":"https://github.com/Williamsja0314/edureka-sample-spring-microservices","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2091,"global_rank":310382},{"name":"shreyas-algo/AlgorithmsJava","owner":"shreyas-algo","html_url":"https://github.com/shreyas-algo/AlgorithmsJava","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Algorithm Practice.
