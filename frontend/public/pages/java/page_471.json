The model had to compute and calculate the arithmetic. The first server has few operators and the second system other operations. If the client requested the arithmetic involving the operator from the first client then the response is directed to the client.If the arithmetic involves the operation from the second server then the operation is first checked in the initial server then checks in the next server.If the operation is found it computes the calculation and returns the value to the first server, then this server returns the required response to the client. If the requested operation is not found in any server then it prompts for any other operation.","topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416624},{"name":"VHarisop/NTree","owner":"VHarisop","html_url":"https://github.com/VHarisop/NTree","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":2,"language":"Java","description":"A generic custom N-ary tree in Java.","topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416635},{"name":"jayathu/TwitterAppClient","owner":"jayathu","html_url":"https://github.com/jayathu/TwitterAppClient","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":2,"language":"Java","description":"Twitter client which displays the home timeline and can compose a tweet.","topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416647},{"name":"jayathu/NewYorkTimesArticleSearch-Project1","owner":"jayathu","html_url":"https://github.com/jayathu/NewYorkTimesArticleSearch-Project1","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Java","description":"New York Times News Search article app which allows a user to find old articles","topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416648},{"name":"breeze4/url-shortener","owner":"breeze4","html_url":"https://github.com/breeze4/url-shortener","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Simple URL shortener","topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416653},{"name":"navidRoohi/TempFile","owner":"navidRoohi","html_url":"https://github.com/navidRoohi/TempFile","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"meetup files","topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416664},{"name":"flowbish/TimePermissions","owner":"flowbish","html_url":"https://github.com/flowbish/TimePermissions","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Playtime based permissions for your Bukkit Minecraft Server","topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416666},{"name":"mooman219/CSCI261","owner":"mooman219","html_url":"https://github.com/mooman219/CSCI261","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Analysis of Algorithms","topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416669},{"name":"kanishkt/Direction","owner":"kanishkt","html_url":"https://github.com/kanishkt/Direction","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416692},{"name":"nlflint/CSC143","owner":"nlflint","html_url":"https://github.com/nlflint/CSC143","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416733},{"name":"nlflint/CSC142","owner":"nlflint","html_url":"https://github.com/nlflint/CSC142","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416734},{"name":"nlflint/AD315","owner":"nlflint","html_url":"https://github.com/nlflint/AD315","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416735},{"name":"nlflint/AD310","owner":"nlflint","html_url":"https://github.com/nlflint/AD310","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416736},{"name":"nlflint/AD325","owner":"nlflint","html_url":"https://github.com/nlflint/AD325","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416737},{"name":"mfcecilia/practice-questions-01","owner":"mfcecilia","html_url":"https://github.com/mfcecilia/practice-questions-01","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"VT Programming team lecture 2016.02.16","topics":["anagrams","arraylist","data-structures","duplicates","java","lecture","notes","programming-exercise","string-builder","sum"],"score":1846,"global_rank":416757},{"name":"CecileRobertMichon/assignment428B","owner":"CecileRobertMichon","html_url":"https://github.com/CecileRobertMichon/assignment428B","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1846,"global_rank":416759},{"name":"kevintrancs/Todo_Planner","owner":"kevintrancs","html_url":"https://github.com/kevintrancs/Todo_Planner","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"THIS IS ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES AND SO I CAN PRINT WITHOUT .ZIP FILES FOR HARD COPY.
