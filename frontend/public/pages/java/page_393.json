All boarders share 4 person bedrooms, which their arrangements are organised by my client every year. During the arrangement process my client collects all information about the boarders to ensure a diverse range of people in each room, and to do so my client looks at factors such as tidiness and noise level. After interviewing my client, I have found out that he finds the current system used to handle the information of boarders to be troublesome.  Thus we resolved it be best to replace the old manual system with a database management program. The program will allow the houseparent to collect all information and access it through a database, and will display whatever information my client needs to refer to when arranging the rooms.","topics":[],"score":1888},{"name":"kevvurs/opencareers","owner":"kevvurs","html_url":"https://github.com/kevvurs/opencareers","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"crowd-powered job listings","topics":[],"score":1888},{"name":"chizhg/coolweather","owner":"chizhg","html_url":"https://github.com/chizhg/coolweather","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1888},{"name":"slbrtg/tasks-spark","owner":"slbrtg","html_url":"https://github.com/slbrtg/tasks-spark","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1888},{"name":"slbrtg/change-machine-spark","owner":"slbrtg","html_url":"https://github.com/slbrtg/change-machine-spark","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1888},{"name":"slbrtg/madlibs-spark","owner":"slbrtg","html_url":"https://github.com/slbrtg/madlibs-spark","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1888},{"name":"slbrtg/spark-demo","owner":"slbrtg","html_url":"https://github.com/slbrtg/spark-demo","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1888},{"name":"slbrtg/spark-skeleton","owner":"slbrtg","html_url":"https://github.com/slbrtg/spark-skeleton","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1888},{"name":"slbrtg/event-planner-java","owner":"slbrtg","html_url":"https://github.com/slbrtg/event-planner-java","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1888},{"name":"slbrtg/java-skeleton","owner":"slbrtg","html_url":"https://github.com/slbrtg/java-skeleton","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1888},{"name":"slbrtg/CDStore-java-cli","owner":"slbrtg","html_url":"https://github.com/slbrtg/CDStore-java-cli","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1888},{"name":"slbrtg/used-car-dealer","owner":"slbrtg","html_url":"https://github.com/slbrtg/used-car-dealer","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1888},{"name":"HarshalNeelkamal/BinarySearchTree","owner":"HarshalNeelkamal","html_url":"https://github.com/HarshalNeelkamal/BinarySearchTree","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"for comparitive heights of BTS and AVL tree with N nodes. also contains classes with implemented BST and AVL tree.
