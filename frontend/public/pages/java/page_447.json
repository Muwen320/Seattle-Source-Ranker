The model had to compute and calculate the arithmetic. The first server has few operators and the second system other operations. If the client requested the arithmetic involving the operator from the first client then the response is directed to the client.If the arithmetic involves the operation from the second server then the operation is first checked in the initial server then checks in the next server.If the operation is found it computes the calculation and returns the value to the first server, then this server returns the required response to the client. If the requested operation is not found in any server then it prompts for any other operation.","topics":[],"score":1921,"global_rank":349678},{"name":"gitskim/football_udacity","owner":"gitskim","html_url":"https://github.com/gitskim/football_udacity","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"One of Udacity projects with widget and sync adapters","topics":[],"score":1921,"global_rank":349682},{"name":"aarya-ci/ProjectEuler","owner":"aarya-ci","html_url":"https://github.com/aarya-ci/ProjectEuler","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Some walkthrough for Project Euler question in java and python","topics":[],"score":1921,"global_rank":349694},{"name":"helloram52/practice","owner":"helloram52","html_url":"https://github.com/helloram52/practice","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Solutions to Interview questions and other practice problems","topics":[],"score":1921,"global_rank":349696},{"name":"ayoung1/TurnBasedRoguelike","owner":"ayoung1","html_url":"https://github.com/ayoung1/TurnBasedRoguelike","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A turn based strategy roguelike","topics":[],"score":1921,"global_rank":349711},{"name":"Shanghai-/eat-at-brown-android","owner":"Shanghai-","html_url":"https://github.com/Shanghai-/eat-at-brown-android","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Android version of Eat@Brown iOS app","topics":[],"score":1921,"global_rank":349722},{"name":"ameenkhan07/chathubber","owner":"ameenkhan07","html_url":"https://github.com/ameenkhan07/chathubber","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":2,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Chat application","topics":[],"score":1921,"global_rank":349729},{"name":"juanjoneri/Console","owner":"juanjoneri","html_url":"https://github.com/juanjoneri/Console","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A \"library\" which allows the user to draw in the command line.
