The classic space invaders didn't have enough players. Not only that, but such an integral classic in gaming history deserves a revamped, high-definition, JFrame-compatible reboot.

Having surrounded a grouped band of foes, the band of bold blocks resolve to rout the rancorous reds. Now the compatriots must unite in concentration of wills to wipe out the wiley combatants. Can you and your quadrilateral comrades completely crush the cursed cruelty of crimson?
