We describe the link state routing approach to APR in connection-oriented networks, and evaluate their performance using simulations. The source node transmits the node to its nearest neighbor and depending on the approach, alternate paths can be computed at intermediate nodes. We present initial simulation results to show the working and mechanism of APR using J2ME Wireless Toolkit. Further, we look at full network level privacy spectrum which comprises of identity, route, location and data privacy. Existing privacy schemes of wireless sensor networks only provide partial network level privacy. In this project, we propose full network level privacy solution that addresses this problem in APR protocols. This solution comprises of Identity, Route, Location (IRL) and data privacy mechanism that collectively provides protection against privacy disclosure attacks such as eavesdropping and hop-by-hop trace back attacks.","topics":[],"score":3097,"global_rank":22818},{"name":"samskivert/immutablej","owner":"samskivert","html_url":"https://github.com/samskivert/immutablej","stars":15,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A
