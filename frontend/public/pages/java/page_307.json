It will show the winner after it races. The purpose of the game is to have all the characters play a sort of \"capture the flag\" game. In which all characters are trying to get \"carrots\" as a point token and all of them are fighting against each other to reach the goal of winning. Characters are trying to eat each other and making it impossible to win for certain characters. Whoever eats the most and is the last person standing wins the game.","topics":[],"score":2099},{"name":"AndresPena-Engineer/DataStructures-in-Java","owner":"AndresPena-Engineer","html_url":"https://github.com/AndresPena-Engineer/DataStructures-in-Java","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"BinarySearchTree, QuickSort, SortMethods, Dijktra, RedandBlackTrees","topics":[],"score":2099},{"name":"AndresPena-Engineer/MovieFinder","owner":"AndresPena-Engineer","html_url":"https://github.com/AndresPena-Engineer/MovieFinder","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"This is an android app that uses SQLight to store all of the movies chosen by the user.
