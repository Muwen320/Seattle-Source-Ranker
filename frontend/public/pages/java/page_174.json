It parses a .task file, that will be specified on the command line. A file of n lines will define n different tasks. Each line of the file is a tab-separated list, where the first token is some new task, and all remaining tokens are the other tasks that must be done prior to it. Every listed task in the file will be the first task on exactly one line, and no task is directly dependent on itself. This program first determines whether or not there are tasks that are mutually dependent. It will output the answer to that question. When no tasks are co-dependent, the program will then output a numbered list which sorts the tasks into a valid order. However, some .task files will contain mutual dependencies. If several tasks are dependent on each other (either directly or indirectly), then they must be done at the same time. In this case, some numbered items will be comma-separated lists.","topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183257},{"name":"bishan-batel/Q3","owner":"bishan-batel","html_url":"https://github.com/bishan-batel/Q3","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183263},{"name":"shipitsteven/simple-fractal","owner":"shipitsteven","html_url":"https://github.com/shipitsteven/simple-fractal","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A Java program that generates a cactus-shaped fractal drawing, comes with Swing GUI.","topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183269},{"name":"zhaoguanchen/JavaFx-Lab-Resource-System","owner":"zhaoguanchen","html_url":"https://github.com/zhaoguanchen/JavaFx-Lab-Resource-System","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Lab Resource Sharing System","topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183340},{"name":"sumantmurke/CodingProblems","owner":"sumantmurke","html_url":"https://github.com/sumantmurke/CodingProblems","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183412},{"name":"dj0894/JavaDesignPattern","owner":"dj0894","html_url":"https://github.com/dj0894/JavaDesignPattern","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Implementing Different Design Patterns using Java","topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183422},{"name":"dj0894/ConceptImplementation","owner":"dj0894","html_url":"https://github.com/dj0894/ConceptImplementation","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183423},{"name":"Hadddock/thisorthat","owner":"Hadddock","html_url":"https://github.com/Hadddock/thisorthat","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":2,"language":"Java","description":"Trivia maze project","topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183436},{"name":"TVW96/Analyzing_FInancial_Growth_Trends","owner":"TVW96","html_url":"https://github.com/TVW96/Analyzing_FInancial_Growth_Trends","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"video: https://youtu.be/7GRVJWQChQY","topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183450},{"name":"spallanck/Dijkstra","owner":"spallanck","html_url":"https://github.com/spallanck/Dijkstra","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":" This program parses a graph and returns information regarding the shortest paths between specified nodes in the graph.","topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183499},{"name":"spallanck/MinHeap","owner":"spallanck","html_url":"https://github.com/spallanck/MinHeap","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"This program implements a min-heap that has been augmented   * with a map to make certain operations more efficient.","topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183500},{"name":"spallanck/AVLTree","owner":"spallanck","html_url":"https://github.com/spallanck/AVLTree","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"This program implements methods to insert words into standard BST and AVL trees, using helper methods to maintain AVL balance of the tree.","topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183501},{"name":"spallanck/SortingAlgos","owner":"spallanck","html_url":"https://github.com/spallanck/SortingAlgos","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"This program implements several sorting algorithms to sort integer arrays, and has an interface that prompts a user for a type of sorting algorithm and size of array and tells them the number of comparisons it took for the specified sorting algorithm to sort the array","topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183502},{"name":"spallanck/HuffmanCode","owner":"spallanck","html_url":"https://github.com/spallanck/HuffmanCode","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"This program implements a program called HuffmanCode that allows users to compress and decompress files using the Huffman Coding algorithm, which is based on the frequency of the characters in the file.","topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183503},{"name":"adya-shrivastava/FunctionalJava","owner":"adya-shrivastava","html_url":"https://github.com/adya-shrivastava/FunctionalJava","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Advanced Java :: Lambda and Streams","topics":[],"score":2196,"global_rank":183507}]
