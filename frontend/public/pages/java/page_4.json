In normal authentication systems, static passwords are used by users to get in the system but it is a known fact that static passwords are very easy to hack. Thus in this system, a user can select certain points in an image and use them as their password. They are immune to basic hacking techniques like brute force attack & dictionary attacks.","topics":["apache-tomcat","authentication","hacktoberfest","html","java-servlet","web-based"],"score":4210},{"name":"bsmock/k-shortest-paths","owner":"bsmock","html_url":"https://github.com/bsmock/k-shortest-paths","stars":47,"forks":23,"issues":1,"language":"Java","description":"A collection of algorithms (including Yen, Eppstein, and Lazy Eppstein) to compute the K shortest paths between two nodes in a weighted, directed graph, implemented in Java.","topics":["k-shortest-paths"],"score":4194},{"name":"Decad3nce/Aegis","owner":"Decad3nce","html_url":"https://github.com/Decad3nce/Aegis","stars":99,"forks":29,"issues":12,"language":"Java","description":"Remote SMS control app for android devices > API 14","topics":[],"score":4189},{"name":"zznate/hector-examples","owner":"zznate","html_url":"https://github.com/zznate/hector-examples","stars":80,"forks":25,"issues":6,"language":"Java","description":"Various examples of using the Hector API to access Apache Cassandra","topics":[],"score":4188},{"name":"PRNicovich/NicoLase","owner":"PRNicovich","html_url":"https://github.com/PRNicovich/NicoLase","stars":54,"forks":9,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Open-source diode laser combiner, fiber launch, and sequencing controller for fluorescence microscopy","topics":[],"score":4185},{"name":"abhaybd/Whiteboard-Drawer","owner":"abhaybd","html_url":"https://github.com/abhaybd/Whiteboard-Drawer","stars":47,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"CNC machine that draws designs on a whiteboard, powered by Arduino","topics":["arduino","arduino-uno","cnc","robot","servo-motor","stepper-motor"],"score":4183},{"name":"cho-zhang/COMP-550-AlgorithmAnalysis","owner":"cho-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/cho-zhang/COMP-550-AlgorithmAnalysis","stars":34,"forks":65,"issues":3,"language":"Java","description":"Java code for Algorithms and Data Structures Class","topics":[],"score":4179},{"name":"johnewart/gearman-java","owner":"johnewart","html_url":"https://github.com/johnewart/gearman-java","stars":66,"forks":31,"issues":13,"language":"Java","description":"Java Gearman client and Netty-based server with multi-backend support (currently memory, Redis and PostgreSQL).
