The following commands are built in: < and > will get the first key and the last key, respectively. <word and >word will get the predecessor and successor of the word in question. &word will get the rank of a word, while *rank will get the word with integer rank given.","score":2194},{"name":"cleemonaghan/Sorting-Tasks","owner":"cleemonaghan","html_url":"https://github.com/cleemonaghan/Sorting-Tasks","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"This project's goal is to find a valid ordering of a number of tasks using a directed graph. It parses a .task file, that will be specified on the command line. A file of n lines will define n different tasks. Each line of the file is a tab-separated list, where the first token is some new task, and all remaining tokens are the other tasks that must be done prior to it. Every listed task in the file will be the first task on exactly one line, and no task is directly dependent on itself. This program first determines whether or not there are tasks that are mutually dependent. It will output the answer to that question. When no tasks are co-dependent, the program will then output a numbered list which sorts the tasks into a valid order. However, some .task files will contain mutual dependencies. If several tasks are dependent on each other (either directly or indirectly), then they must be done at the same time. In this case, some numbered items will be comma-separated lists.","score":2194},{"name":"emmarise/sfg-di","owner":"emmarise","html_url":"https://github.com/emmarise/sfg-di","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"sara-is-building/HackerRankPractice","owner":"sara-is-building","html_url":"https://github.com/sara-is-building/HackerRankPractice","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"meganaboddam/logistics-of-field-irrigation","owner":"meganaboddam","html_url":"https://github.com/meganaboddam/logistics-of-field-irrigation","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"shaoxcs/flixster","owner":"shaoxcs","html_url":"https://github.com/shaoxcs/flixster","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Java","description":"An android app for browsing movies.","score":2194},{"name":"kishore-jayanthi9/MyLeetCodeSolutions","owner":"kishore-jayanthi9","html_url":"https://github.com/kishore-jayanthi9/MyLeetCodeSolutions","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"bakerston/Mall","owner":"bakerston","html_url":"https://github.com/bakerston/Mall","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Electronic Commercial and Payment System","score":2194},{"name":"goleary/react-native-music-control-min-repro","owner":"goleary","html_url":"https://github.com/goleary/react-native-music-control-min-repro","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"repo to demonstrate issue with react-native-music-control library on Android 11","score":2194},{"name":"Reven9919/INFO5100Spring2022","owner":"Reven9919","html_url":"https://github.com/Reven9919/INFO5100Spring2022","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"glowupmatt/learn-oauth-java","owner":"glowupmatt","html_url":"https://github.com/glowupmatt/learn-oauth-java","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"jnelsonjava/songr","owner":"jnelsonjava","html_url":"https://github.com/jnelsonjava/songr","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"CarterKekoa/autoGenerateSQLdata","owner":"CarterKekoa","html_url":"https://github.com/CarterKekoa/autoGenerateSQLdata","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A program written in Java that will auto create SQL scripts to populate SQL tables","score":2194},{"name":"CarterKekoa/InterfaceSQL","owner":"CarterKekoa","html_url":"https://github.com/CarterKekoa/InterfaceSQL","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A text based interface written in Java is used to interacts with SQL database.
