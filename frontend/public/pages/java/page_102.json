Given the size of Wikipedia and web in general, and the information on such websites answering questions would lead to building a structural and associated data. This report aims at represented how a corpus can be processed to accurately give answers to related questions. For this, new algorithm has been proposed.  A QA implementation, usually a computer program, may construct its answers by querying a structured database of knowledge or information, usually a knowledge base. More commonly, QA systems can pull answers from an unstructured collection of natural language documents. Here a similar attempt at solving the problem has been performed, where part of a article from Wikipedia has been used as corpus and was tested against different type of questions that the program can answer correctly. Advanced QA requires sophisticated text processing tools based on state-of-the-art NLP.","score":2310},{"name":"jasonwjones/hyperion-rejected-record-summary","owner":"jasonwjones","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonwjones/hyperion-rejected-record-summary","stars":1,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A small library/runnable jar that can be used to process one or several Hyperion Essbase rejected record files to provide easy reporting/analysis.","score":2310},{"name":"adheshgarg/Zuul","owner":"adheshgarg","html_url":"https://github.com/adheshgarg/Zuul","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":1,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2310},{"name":"adheshgarg/ECommerce","owner":"adheshgarg","html_url":"https://github.com/adheshgarg/ECommerce","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2310},{"name":"TrevorStubbs/JavaPlayground","owner":"TrevorStubbs","html_url":"https://github.com/TrevorStubbs/JavaPlayground","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2310},{"name":"Mattaus-Isenberg/quotes","owner":"Mattaus-Isenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Mattaus-Isenberg/quotes","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2310},{"name":"moulid15/AndriodBluetooth","owner":"moulid15","html_url":"https://github.com/moulid15/AndriodBluetooth","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2310},{"name":"notdxlin/ChessCLI","owner":"notdxlin","html_url":"https://github.com/notdxlin/ChessCLI","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":4,"language":"Java","description":"Chess game on the command line.","score":2310},{"name":"Synarcs/CSS-534-Parallel-Programming-Final-Project","owner":"Synarcs","html_url":"https://github.com/Synarcs/CSS-534-Parallel-Programming-Final-Project","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Java","description":"Parallel Implementation of MRGasky Area Skyline Query using mpi, spark, mapreduce and MASS.","score":2310},{"name":"DawsonBolen/springboot","owner":"DawsonBolen","html_url":"https://github.com/DawsonBolen/springboot","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2310},{"name":"keyseahmed/Remove-Duplicate","owner":"keyseahmed","html_url":"https://github.com/keyseahmed/Remove-Duplicate","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Write a method removeDuplicates that takes as a parameter a sorted ArrayList of Strings and that eliminates any duplicates from the list.
