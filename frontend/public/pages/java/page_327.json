Students and Courses application (Part 1) in Lab 1. Now you are asked to improved it in the following ways: (1) Create a TreeMap of course names. Each map entry should contain a single integer that counts the number of students who have enrolled in that course. (2) Display the map in ascending order by course name, showing each course name and its enrollment count. Note: You cannot directly increment the enrollment count in a map entry. Instead, retrieve the existing count using the get() method, add 1 to the count, and then insert the key and updated enrollment count back into the map by calling the put() method.","score":2094},{"name":"aryasoman333/Program-Structures-and-Algorithms","owner":"aryasoman333","html_url":"https://github.com/aryasoman333/Program-Structures-and-Algorithms","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2094},{"name":"henchhing-limbu/GeoQuiz","owner":"henchhing-limbu","html_url":"https://github.com/henchhing-limbu/GeoQuiz","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Assignment for mobile app where you get familiar with recycler view, reading csv files, and back stack.","score":2094},{"name":"sjb3/java142_repo","owner":"sjb3","html_url":"https://github.com/sjb3/java142_repo","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2094},{"name":"srijitravi94/Classifieds","owner":"srijitravi94","html_url":"https://github.com/srijitravi94/Classifieds","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"An android application to buy and sell products","score":2094},{"name":"idodin/ev3-obstacle_avoidance","owner":"idodin","html_url":"https://github.com/idodin/ev3-obstacle_avoidance","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2094},{"name":"KaraCav/JavaPracticeFall2018","owner":"KaraCav","html_url":"https://github.com/KaraCav/JavaPracticeFall2018","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2094},{"name":"haohww/Coinz","owner":"haohww","html_url":"https://github.com/haohww/Coinz","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2094},{"name":"Diegop88/Kontakt-Beacon-Hackathon-","owner":"Diegop88","html_url":"https://github.com/Diegop88/Kontakt-Beacon-Hackathon-","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Hackathon App that works with Kontak.io beacons","score":2094},{"name":"Diegop88/Graphs","owner":"Diegop88","html_url":"https://github.com/Diegop88/Graphs","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Demo how to paint linear graphs in Android with a Custom View","score":2094},{"name":"Mirage-Zero-Nine/Key-Value-Store","owner":"Mirage-Zero-Nine","html_url":"https://github.com/Mirage-Zero-Nine/Key-Value-Store","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A demo that implements key-value store with both client and server with LRU/LFU cache policy.","score":2094},{"name":"varunj/OnDevice","owner":"varunj","html_url":"https://github.com/varunj/OnDevice","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2094},{"name":"uw-it-aca/ya-old-scout-android","owner":"uw-it-aca","html_url":"https://github.com/uw-it-aca/ya-old-scout-android","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2094},{"name":"karannaik/GithubCommitsAndroidApp","owner":"karannaik","html_url":"https://github.com/karannaik/GithubCommitsAndroidApp","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"score":2094},{"name":"shreyas-algo/AlgorithmsJava","owner":"shreyas-algo","html_url":"https://github.com/shreyas-algo/AlgorithmsJava","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Algorithm Practice.
