IMS will be responsible for the inventory tracking within physical, single site warehouses. IMS will track the named physical location of a product within the warehouse and the inventory level of each product. IMS can be deployed to busy warehouses supporting many pickers and restockers working with individual terminals and clients. Updates to inventory levels will be handled in real time to prevent pickers trying to pick a product that is out of stock. The application is a simple standalone application, that manages the inventory stored in the warehouse.","topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":383913},{"name":"cnauroth/hdfs-scan-file","owner":"cnauroth","html_url":"https://github.com/cnauroth/hdfs-scan-file","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Simple command-line application to test scanning through a whole HDFS file.","topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":383924},{"name":"daboross/SkyChat","owner":"daboross","html_url":"https://github.com/daboross/SkyChat","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Super simple chat plugin","topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":383948},{"name":"zoe3351/uwjavatest","owner":"zoe3351","html_url":"https://github.com/zoe3351/uwjavatest","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":383987},{"name":"Ethan-McGregor/activityspy","owner":"Ethan-McGregor","html_url":"https://github.com/Ethan-McGregor/activityspy","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":383999},{"name":"Ethan-McGregor/helloandroid","owner":"Ethan-McGregor","html_url":"https://github.com/Ethan-McGregor/helloandroid","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Simple HelloWorld android app","topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":384007},{"name":"Ethan-McGregor/uwjavatest","owner":"Ethan-McGregor","html_url":"https://github.com/Ethan-McGregor/uwjavatest","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":384008},{"name":"katrinaezis/activityspy","owner":"katrinaezis","html_url":"https://github.com/katrinaezis/activityspy","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":384019},{"name":"katrinaezis/helloandroid","owner":"katrinaezis","html_url":"https://github.com/katrinaezis/helloandroid","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":384020},{"name":"katrinaezis/uwjavatest","owner":"katrinaezis","html_url":"https://github.com/katrinaezis/uwjavatest","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":384021},{"name":"Drea567/Notes","owner":"Drea567","html_url":"https://github.com/Drea567/Notes","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":384035},{"name":"Drea567/Polynomial","owner":"Drea567","html_url":"https://github.com/Drea567/Polynomial","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Worksheet 1 - CSC 143","topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":384036},{"name":"idiotleon/Capstone-Project","owner":"idiotleon","html_url":"https://github.com/idiotleon/Capstone-Project","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":384039},{"name":"ddworken/bingoManager","owner":"ddworken","html_url":"https://github.com/ddworken/bingoManager","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1873,"global_rank":384040},{"name":"fierlion/javaTest","owner":"fierlion","html_url":"https://github.com/fierlion/javaTest","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"prep questions.
