Given the size of Wikipedia and web in general, and the information on such websites answering questions would lead to building a structural and associated data. This report aims at represented how a corpus can be processed to accurately give answers to related questions. For this, new algorithm has been proposed.  A QA implementation, usually a computer program, may construct its answers by querying a structured database of knowledge or information, usually a knowledge base. More commonly, QA systems can pull answers from an unstructured collection of natural language documents. Here a similar attempt at solving the problem has been performed, where part of a article from Wikipedia has been used as corpus and was tested against different type of questions that the program can answer correctly. Advanced QA requires sophisticated text processing tools based on state-of-the-art NLP.","topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128675},{"name":"TobiasWooldridge/revive-survive","owner":"TobiasWooldridge","html_url":"https://github.com/TobiasWooldridge/revive-survive","stars":1,"forks":1,"watchers":2,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"App for #Govhack 2014 (#Unleashed)","topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128676},{"name":"ryanvickr/Binary-Search-Tree","owner":"ryanvickr","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanvickr/Binary-Search-Tree","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"A simple application which scans a data file and stores it in a custom-built binary search tree.","topics":["binary-search-tree"],"score":2308,"global_rank":128679},{"name":"camerongineer/Chuck_Norris_Cipher_Encoder_Java","owner":"camerongineer","html_url":"https://github.com/camerongineer/Chuck_Norris_Cipher_Encoder_Java","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Chuck Norris Cipher Encoder written in Java","topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128723},{"name":"IamNicoleDenise/DecisionStructures","owner":"IamNicoleDenise","html_url":"https://github.com/IamNicoleDenise/DecisionStructures","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128775},{"name":"IamNicoleDenise/SalaryCaculator","owner":"IamNicoleDenise","html_url":"https://github.com/IamNicoleDenise/SalaryCaculator","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128776},{"name":"IamNicoleDenise/JavaEssentials","owner":"IamNicoleDenise","html_url":"https://github.com/IamNicoleDenise/JavaEssentials","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128777},{"name":"dankank22/huffman-compressor","owner":"dankank22","html_url":"https://github.com/dankank22/huffman-compressor","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"This project implements Huffman coding in Java for compressing and decompressing files, featuring methods to construct Huffman trees, save codes, and translate encoded data.","topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128812},{"name":"youncher/CS361_team20_todo_list","owner":"youncher","html_url":"https://github.com/youncher/CS361_team20_todo_list","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":3,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128821},{"name":"FrenchieAP/Java-DaikichiPathVariables","owner":"FrenchieAP","html_url":"https://github.com/FrenchieAP/Java-DaikichiPathVariables","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128866},{"name":"FrenchieAP/Java-Human","owner":"FrenchieAP","html_url":"https://github.com/FrenchieAP/Java-Human","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128867},{"name":"FrenchieAP/Java-Daikichi-Routes","owner":"FrenchieAP","html_url":"https://github.com/FrenchieAP/Java-Daikichi-Routes","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128869},{"name":"FrenchieAP/Java-Zookeeper","owner":"FrenchieAP","html_url":"https://github.com/FrenchieAP/Java-Zookeeper","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128870},{"name":"FrenchieAP/Java-AlredBot","owner":"FrenchieAP","html_url":"https://github.com/FrenchieAP/Java-AlredBot","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128871},{"name":"FrenchieAP/Java-BankAccount","owner":"FrenchieAP","html_url":"https://github.com/FrenchieAP/Java-BankAccount","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128872},{"name":"yashaswinikbr/100DaysProgrammingChallenge","owner":"yashaswinikbr","html_url":"https://github.com/yashaswinikbr/100DaysProgrammingChallenge","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2308,"global_rank":128875},{"name":"iShoe/findYourStore","owner":"iShoe","html_url":"https://github.com/iShoe/findYourStore","stars":0,"forks":1,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"Android application used to find required items in stores nearby and navigate to them.
