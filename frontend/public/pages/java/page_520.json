The classic space invaders didn't have enough players. Not only that, but such an integral classic in gaming history deserves a revamped, high-definition, JFrame-compatible reboot. This is like the JJ Abrams reboot of Star Trek, only with less lens flares and MORE pixels. In this digital epic, an escadrille of four squares face the daunting task of eliminating red squares. Having surrounded a grouped band of foes, the band of bold blocks resolve to rout the rancorous reds. Now the compatriots must unite in concentration of wills to wipe out the wiley combatants. Can you and your quadrilateral comrades completely crush the cursed cruelty of crimson?
