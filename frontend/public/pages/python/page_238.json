Each stone is also called a Pichu. Initially the board starts empty, except for two rows of white Pichus on the second and third row of the board, and two rows of black Pichus on rows n \u2212 2 and n \u2212 1. Two players alternate turns, with White going first. When a Pichu reaches the opposite side of the board (i.e. when a Black Pichu reaches row 1 or a white Pichu reaches row n), then the Pichu is marked with an X and becomes a Pikachu.","topics":[],"score":2491},{"name":"ahope/iot_clock","owner":"ahope","html_url":"https://github.com/ahope/iot_clock","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Code for the IoT clock on the mantle.
