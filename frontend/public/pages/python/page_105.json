We wanted to implement this idea to Classrooms and emphasise on the Smart Attendance System. We wrote the code in Python and we used techniques such as Haar-Cascading to detect the trained object (face).  There are 3 steps involved: Training, Testing and Prediction. A persons image will be captured in different light intensities and pose. These images are stored in the database. This is training. When the person faces the camera, his/her images will be verified with that of the trained images in the database. This is testing. The final step is the prediction, which tells us if it is a success ( when there is a match between the image captured and the images in the database) or a failure ( when there is no match between the image captured and the images in the database).","score":2996},{"name":"CrustyAuklet/ATDF-parse","owner":"CrustyAuklet","html_url":"https://github.com/CrustyAuklet/ATDF-parse","stars":3,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"Atmel ATDF parser written in python for code generation","score":2996},{"name":"jmnorma/Autograder_Gradescope_Demo","owner":"jmnorma","html_url":"https://github.com/jmnorma/Autograder_Gradescope_Demo","stars":2,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"This is a repository reporting how to create GradeScope Autograders for C/C++ using Python.
