Projects that make use of the files' EXIF metadata can benefit from Robinson's automatic import of EXIF metadata at the time the model is saved. Moreover, Robinson offers built-in geolocation utility methods as well as fully functional admin forms that make it trivial to geocode photos that are missing geolocation EXIF metadata. As of right now, this application forces every photo to have a location, either specified manually through the admin form or automatically imported from the file's EXIF metadata.
