In a distributed system, data replication ensures reliability and availability among nodes: if one or more servers fail, the system can still function properly even though the node which contains the write is not available. The performance of the system can also be improved due to lower access time and higher scalability; we can reduce response time as the data can be acquired locally, and the system can scale better as requests can be serviced by multiple servers instead of one.","score":2656},{"name":"hanseaston/stock-prediction-project","owner":"hanseaston","html_url":"https://github.com/hanseaston/stock-prediction-project","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"score":2656},{"name":"wangw05/yt-datasets","owner":"wangw05","html_url":"https://github.com/wangw05/yt-datasets","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Utilizing Youtube Data API v3 to obtain video statistics and information (such as likes and comments) saved to a csv, allowing for further analysis.
