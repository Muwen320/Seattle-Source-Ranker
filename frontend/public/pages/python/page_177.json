Hands-free interaction with our machine altered the way people do things like taking a screenshot, Automatic shutdown or lock the system via voice, searching for a file in a file system, google searching & YouTube searching, and writing notes through voice command. The world of Data Science is being explored more intensively than ever before. Also, it has opened the doors to build assistants in various industries such as health care, automobile, marketing, and education. Many assistants had been introduced to the software industry by Google, Apple, and Microsoft. However, in this paper, we have demonstrated how to implement the virtual assistant empowered with disease prediction and movie recommendation based on the mood that an inquisitive starter can understand, by integrating the concepts of Automatic speech recognition, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and Interprocess communication. Having a robust assistant improves the time efficiency as well as reduces the efforts to perform simple repetitive tasks.","topics":[],"score":2536},{"name":"fossage/Dev-Job-Visualization","owner":"fossage","html_url":"https://github.com/fossage/Dev-Job-Visualization","stars":1,"forks":5,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"An app that creates data visualizations based on web development jobs in the US.
