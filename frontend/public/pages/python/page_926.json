chatbot is a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.","topics":[],"score":1896},{"name":"valdezr1/Python-IO","owner":"valdezr1","html_url":"https://github.com/valdezr1/Python-IO","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Playing around with Python","topics":[],"score":1896},{"name":"EVictorson/BB_controls_analysis","owner":"EVictorson","html_url":"https://github.com/EVictorson/BB_controls_analysis","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Python tools for black block time and frequency domain controls analysis from experimental data","topics":[],"score":1896},{"name":"tmparayil/Excel-Oracle-DB-Python-script","owner":"tmparayil","html_url":"https://github.com/tmparayil/Excel-Oracle-DB-Python-script","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1896},{"name":"You-NeverKnow/algorithmPractice","owner":"You-NeverKnow","html_url":"https://github.com/You-NeverKnow/algorithmPractice","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Practicing algorithms from Skienna book","topics":[],"score":1896},{"name":"MichaelSEA/petsit","owner":"MichaelSEA","html_url":"https://github.com/MichaelSEA/petsit","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1896},{"name":"Krish-Mahajan/fannie-mae-loan-prediction","owner":"Krish-Mahajan","html_url":"https://github.com/Krish-Mahajan/fannie-mae-loan-prediction","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1896},{"name":"vrnmthr/CptGen","owner":"vrnmthr","html_url":"https://github.com/vrnmthr/CptGen","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"An intelligent counterpoint generator","topics":[],"score":1896},{"name":"Tsarcastic/Python-401-Pre-Work","owner":"Tsarcastic","html_url":"https://github.com/Tsarcastic/Python-401-Pre-Work","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1896},{"name":"nalderto/Custom-Dice-Simulation","owner":"nalderto","html_url":"https://github.com/nalderto/Custom-Dice-Simulation","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"An AP Statistics demonstration with various amounts of dice","topics":["python3","statistics","tkinter"],"score":1896},{"name":"omolazabal/snapberry-pi","owner":"omolazabal","html_url":"https://github.com/omolazabal/snapberry-pi","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Takes pictures and applies face filters.","topics":["face-detection","haar-cascade","opencv","picamera","python","raspberry-pi"],"score":1896},{"name":"vjoshi19/djangoProjects","owner":"vjoshi19","html_url":"https://github.com/vjoshi19/djangoProjects","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1896},{"name":"bhuvankaruturi/python_programs","owner":"bhuvankaruturi","html_url":"https://github.com/bhuvankaruturi/python_programs","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Contains Python Programs","topics":[],"score":1896},{"name":"paulfranco/poke","owner":"paulfranco","html_url":"https://github.com/paulfranco/poke","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1895}]
