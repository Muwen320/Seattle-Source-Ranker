[{"name":"flebel/django-robinson","owner":"flebel","html_url":"https://github.com/flebel/django-robinson","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"Robinson is a Django application that can be used as the underlying foundation for a project that stores references to JPEG files as model instances. Projects that make use of the files' EXIF metadata can benefit from Robinson's automatic import of EXIF metadata at the time the model is saved. Moreover, Robinson offers built-in geolocation utility methods as well as fully functional admin forms that make it trivial to geocode photos that are missing geolocation EXIF metadata. As of right now, this application forces every photo to have a location, either specified manually through the admin form or automatically imported from the file's EXIF metadata. There are future plans to make it suitable for less specific use cases.","topics":[],"score":2520,"global_rank":64315},{"name":"jon/predabot","owner":"jon","html_url":"https://github.com/jon/predabot","stars":4,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Predatory Roomba control","topics":[],"score":2520,"global_rank":64319},{"name":"Salahatabani/CART_Boosting_Bagging_RandomForests","owner":"Salahatabani","html_url":"https://github.com/Salahatabani/CART_Boosting_Bagging_RandomForests","stars":3,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Python implementation of CART, Random Forests and AdaBoost","topics":[],"score":2520,"global_rank":64331},{"name":"apachols/pympdrome","owner":"apachols","html_url":"https://github.com/apachols/pympdrome","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"mpd driver for radio hypnodrome","topics":[],"score":2520,"global_rank":64345},{"name":"kenrhe/passtheturing","owner":"kenrhe","html_url":"https://github.com/kenrhe/passtheturing","stars":2,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2520,"global_rank":64346},{"name":"aramshiva/data","owner":"aramshiva","html_url":"https://github.com/aramshiva/data","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"\ud83d\udcbd Analyzing Seattle Data","topics":[],"score":2520,"global_rank":64373},{"name":"sanket1729/Seoulbitcoin-scripts","owner":"sanket1729","html_url":"https://github.com/sanket1729/Seoulbitcoin-scripts","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2520,"global_rank":64374},{"name":"JonLMyers/Inb4-Danger","owner":"JonLMyers","html_url":"https://github.com/JonLMyers/Inb4-Danger","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":3,"language":"Python","description":"Turning my private Facebook messages into graphs","topics":[],"score":2520,"global_rank":64377},{"name":"robalford/django_pwa","owner":"robalford","html_url":"https://github.com/robalford/django_pwa","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Django project as Progressive Web Application","topics":[],"score":2520,"global_rank":64391},{"name":"jchbenjamin/d20","owner":"jchbenjamin","html_url":"https://github.com/jchbenjamin/d20","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"Dungeon Twentiez","topics":[],"score":2520,"global_rank":64399},{"name":"empathephant/automatic-essay-grader","owner":"empathephant","html_url":"https://github.com/empathephant/automatic-essay-grader","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Machine learning project that attempts to grade essays written by non-native English speakers on a scale from 1 - 7.
