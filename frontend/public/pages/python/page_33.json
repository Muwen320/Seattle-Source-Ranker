Automated daily model quality evaluation and system supervision with Jinkens. Designed and built the infrastructure that can incrementally deploy new versions of recommendation service triggered by canary release and A/B testing. Integrated with feedback loops mechanism to detect potential positive or negative feedback loops to further identify potential adversarial attacks. Implemented the monitoring and detection by applying lambda architecture to combine the stream and batch processing results to detect problematic behaviors. Comprehensive data quality control on raw data received from Kafka stream, especially focus on data schema issues, missing data, and duplicated data. Monitoring Dashboard UI with D3.js. Developed the whole web server by Flask. Containerized the whole service by Docker.","topics":[],"score":3657},{"name":"goncalorafaria/BlueCoins-ExportTool","owner":"goncalorafaria","html_url":"https://github.com/goncalorafaria/BlueCoins-ExportTool","stars":19,"forks":4,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"Python script that converts the backup data files to csv.","topics":[],"score":3657},{"name":"d4r3topk/comparing-audio-files-python","owner":"d4r3topk","html_url":"https://github.com/d4r3topk/comparing-audio-files-python","stars":33,"forks":17,"issues":4,"language":"Python","description":"This project is for the comparison of two audio files based on their MFCC's.","topics":[],"score":3655},{"name":"tileb1/motion-prediction-tim","owner":"tileb1","html_url":"https://github.com/tileb1/motion-prediction-tim","stars":19,"forks":2,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"This repo contains the code for the ACCV 2020 paper Motion Prediction using Temporal Inception Module.","topics":[],"score":3655},{"name":"nvmcr/DataScience_HandBook","owner":"nvmcr","html_url":"https://github.com/nvmcr/DataScience_HandBook","stars":9,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"A quick guide to Data Science, DBMS, and AWS concepts","topics":["aws","cheatsheets","data-science","dbms","deep-learning","machine-learning","machine-learning-cheatsheet","neural-networks","probability","probability-cheatsheet","sql","statistics","statistics-cheatsheet"],"score":3655},{"name":"kaiwensun/AWS-cmd-translate","owner":"kaiwensun","html_url":"https://github.com/kaiwensun/AWS-cmd-translate","stars":6,"forks":3,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"A command line translation tool backed by Amazon Translate, Youdao and Baidu","topics":[],"score":3655},{"name":"hungtraan/FacebookBot-echobot-simple","owner":"hungtraan","html_url":"https://github.com/hungtraan/FacebookBot-echobot-simple","stars":29,"forks":18,"issues":4,"language":"Python","description":"Simple echobot for Facebook Messenger API","topics":[],"score":3654},{"name":"kthyng/cmocean-paraview","owner":"kthyng","html_url":"https://github.com/kthyng/cmocean-paraview","stars":18,"forks":7,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"cmocean colormaps for Paraview","topics":[],"score":3654},{"name":"keith/xcframework-to-fat","owner":"keith","html_url":"https://github.com/keith/xcframework-to-fat","stars":17,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Create a fat framework from an xcframework bundle","topics":["xcframework","xcode"],"score":3654},{"name":"ThomasGust/SoilingNet","owner":"ThomasGust","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasGust/SoilingNet","stars":10,"forks":4,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"This repository is for the SoilingNet Project.
