The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application. The n-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus. When the items are words, n-grams may also be called shingles.[1]  An n-gram of size 1 is referred to as a \"unigram\"; size 2 is a \"bigram\" (or, less commonly, a \"digram\"); size 3 is a \"trigram\". Larger sizes are sometimes referred to by the value of n, e.g., \"four-gram\", \"five-gram\", and so on.","score":2302},{"name":"segerphilip/HackMIT2015","owner":"segerphilip","html_url":"https://github.com/segerphilip/HackMIT2015","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Team: Byron, Keenan, Patrick, and Philip","score":2302},{"name":"Beophucanh/JSON-pars-","owner":"Beophucanh","html_url":"https://github.com/Beophucanh/JSON-pars-","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"score":2302},{"name":"randyydoo/Project1","owner":"randyydoo","html_url":"https://github.com/randyydoo/Project1","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Project 1 for CPSC 335","score":2302},{"name":"CoreyCole/ik-capstone","owner":"CoreyCole","html_url":"https://github.com/CoreyCole/ik-capstone","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"score":2302},{"name":"kairstenfay/yang-bot","owner":"kairstenfay","html_url":"https://github.com/kairstenfay/yang-bot","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"A Twitter bot that Tweets Andrew Yang policies.","score":2302},{"name":"j-balkovec/CPSC4260","owner":"j-balkovec","html_url":"https://github.com/j-balkovec/CPSC4260","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Software Design & Refactoring","score":2302},{"name":"kpwhri/jsonl_index","owner":"kpwhri","html_url":"https://github.com/kpwhri/jsonl_index","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"score":2302},{"name":"ruvamd/colosovo-htmx-django","owner":"ruvamd","html_url":"https://github.com/ruvamd/colosovo-htmx-django","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"colosovo website: htmx,django","score":2302},{"name":"milesbarr/python-utils","owner":"milesbarr","html_url":"https://github.com/milesbarr/python-utils","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"A collection of Python utility scripts.","score":2302},{"name":"MikeMac15/SE_EdCenter","owner":"MikeMac15","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMac15/SE_EdCenter","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"score":2302},{"name":"aobaruwa/Atari-Pong","owner":"aobaruwa","html_url":"https://github.com/aobaruwa/Atari-Pong","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Self playing Atari Pong agent beats the computer.
