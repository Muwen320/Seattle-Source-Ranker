Moreover, Robinson offers built-in geolocation utility methods as well as fully functional admin forms that make it trivial to geocode photos that are missing geolocation EXIF metadata. As of right now, this application forces every photo to have a location, either specified manually through the admin form or automatically imported from the file's EXIF metadata. There are future plans to make it suitable for less specific use cases.","topics":[],"score":2521},{"name":"jon/predabot","owner":"jon","html_url":"https://github.com/jon/predabot","stars":4,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Predatory Roomba control","topics":[],"score":2521},{"name":"Salahatabani/CART_Boosting_Bagging_RandomForests","owner":"Salahatabani","html_url":"https://github.com/Salahatabani/CART_Boosting_Bagging_RandomForests","stars":3,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Python implementation of CART, Random Forests and AdaBoost","topics":[],"score":2521},{"name":"kenrhe/passtheturing","owner":"kenrhe","html_url":"https://github.com/kenrhe/passtheturing","stars":2,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2521},{"name":"greenrazer/capture-powermetrics","owner":"greenrazer","html_url":"https://github.com/greenrazer/capture-powermetrics","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2521},{"name":"bjherger/Shower_thoughts_generator","owner":"bjherger","html_url":"https://github.com/bjherger/Shower_thoughts_generator","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2521},{"name":"fengzhang789/Social-Media-Marketing-Simulator-Final-Summative","owner":"fengzhang789","html_url":"https://github.com/fengzhang789/Social-Media-Marketing-Simulator-Final-Summative","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"A typing game I made for my ICS 3UI Summative.
