The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application. The n-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus. When the items are words, n-grams may also be called shingles.[1]  An n-gram of size 1 is referred to as a \"unigram\"; size 2 is a \"bigram\" (or, less commonly, a \"digram\"); size 3 is a \"trigram\". Larger sizes are sometimes referred to by the value of n, e.g., \"four-gram\", \"five-gram\", and so on.","topics":[],"score":2300,"global_rank":106860},{"name":"FredHutch/HutchNER","owner":"FredHutch","html_url":"https://github.com/FredHutch/HutchNER","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":5,"language":"Python","description":"The Fred Hutch Named Entity Recognition general training and execution pipeline","topics":[],"score":2300,"global_rank":106867},{"name":"segerphilip/HackMIT2015","owner":"segerphilip","html_url":"https://github.com/segerphilip/HackMIT2015","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Team: Byron, Keenan, Patrick, and Philip","topics":[],"score":2300,"global_rank":106875},{"name":"MrinmayeeKulkarni/gcpsample","owner":"MrinmayeeKulkarni","html_url":"https://github.com/MrinmayeeKulkarni/gcpsample","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"Continuous Delivery with Google Cloud Platform","topics":[],"score":2300,"global_rank":106880},{"name":"RalphAlexander/HealthsyncAPI","owner":"RalphAlexander","html_url":"https://github.com/RalphAlexander/HealthsyncAPI","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"HealthsyncAPI is a RESTful API designed to manage and synchronize health-related data for healthcare applications.","topics":[],"score":2300,"global_rank":106884},{"name":"beaherrera/cantata-v1-model","owner":"beaherrera","html_url":"https://github.com/beaherrera/cantata-v1-model","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2300,"global_rank":106899},{"name":"madhavmk/Consistent_Hashing","owner":"madhavmk","html_url":"https://github.com/madhavmk/Consistent_Hashing","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2300,"global_rank":106903},{"name":"andmarek/advent-of-code-2023","owner":"andmarek","html_url":"https://github.com/andmarek/advent-of-code-2023","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2300,"global_rank":106904},{"name":"changlaplace/PDE_network","owner":"changlaplace","html_url":"https://github.com/changlaplace/PDE_network","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2300,"global_rank":106908},{"name":"sandraoluoch/CNN-Model-Training-EMT","owner":"sandraoluoch","html_url":"https://github.com/sandraoluoch/CNN-Model-Training-EMT","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Exploratory code for generating 3D binary segmentations of cell colonies undergoing EMT.
