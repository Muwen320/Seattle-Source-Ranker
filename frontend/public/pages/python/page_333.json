The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application. The n-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus. When the items are words, n-grams may also be called shingles.[1]  An n-gram of size 1 is referred to as a \"unigram\"; size 2 is a \"bigram\" (or, less commonly, a \"digram\"); size 3 is a \"trigram\". Larger sizes are sometimes referred to by the value of n, e.g., \"four-gram\", \"five-gram\", and so on.","topics":[],"score":2300},{"name":"romerocesar/fota","owner":"romerocesar","html_url":"https://github.com/romerocesar/fota","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"python code to control an LED strip from raspberry pi","topics":[],"score":2300},{"name":"LauraCarter/Advent-of-Code","owner":"LauraCarter","html_url":"https://github.com/LauraCarter/Advent-of-Code","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2300},{"name":"boezzz/HireRL","owner":"boezzz","html_url":"https://github.com/boezzz/HireRL","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2300},{"name":"Melody-coder923/Leetcode-Practice","owner":"Melody-coder923","html_url":"https://github.com/Melody-coder923/Leetcode-Practice","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Collection of LeetCode questions to ace the coding interview!
