Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.","topics":[],"score":1896},{"name":"pranavsb/pi_iot_server_nokia","owner":"pranavsb","html_url":"https://github.com/pranavsb/pi_iot_server_nokia","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1896},{"name":"rfukutome/program-memory-usage-monitor","owner":"rfukutome","html_url":"https://github.com/rfukutome/program-memory-usage-monitor","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Program
