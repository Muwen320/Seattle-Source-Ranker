[{"name":"mssrinivas/Distributed-File-Storage","owner":"mssrinivas","html_url":"https://github.com/mssrinivas/Distributed-File-Storage","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"This project provides a detailed explanation of the data replication part in the Distributed File Storage System. In a distributed system, data replication ensures reliability and availability among nodes: if one or more servers fail, the system can still function properly even though the node which contains the write is not available. The performance of the system can also be improved due to lower access time and higher scalability; we can reduce response time as the data can be acquired locally, and the system can scale better as requests can be serviced by multiple servers instead of one.","topics":[],"score":2654},{"name":"concavegit/ekf-slam-lidar","owner":"concavegit","html_url":"https://github.com/concavegit/ekf-slam-lidar","stars":1,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"A repo to explore visual odometry and perhaps monocular SLAM","topics":[],"score":2654},{"name":"matthewSorensen/pewpew","owner":"matthewSorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewSorensen/pewpew","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"General CNC firmware for teensy 4.x controllers.","topics":[],"score":2654},{"name":"mgmeyers/markdown-auto-tagger","owner":"mgmeyers","html_url":"https://github.com/mgmeyers/markdown-auto-tagger","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2654},{"name":"hanseaston/stock-prediction-project","owner":"hanseaston","html_url":"https://github.com/hanseaston/stock-prediction-project","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2654},{"name":"saulshanabrook/django-response-timeout","owner":"saulshanabrook","html_url":"https://github.com/saulshanabrook/django-response-timeout","stars":4,"forks":1,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"Set response cache times for the whole site","topics":[],"score":2653},{"name":"borismus/Running-Gestures","owner":"borismus","html_url":"https://github.com/borismus/Running-Gestures","stars":4,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Prototype code for detecting pace of a runner, and then detecting when they skip","topics":[],"score":2653},{"name":"stewartadam/flask-kickstart","owner":"stewartadam","html_url":"https://github.com/stewartadam/flask-kickstart","stars":3,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Flask application template for kickstarting development of small to medium sized applications","topics":[],"score":2653},{"name":"jeffkinnison/shadho-tutorial","owner":"jeffkinnison","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffkinnison/shadho-tutorial","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":5,"language":"Python","description":"Tutorial given at WACV 2020 on SHADHO usage.","topics":[],"score":2653},{"name":"ilyaraz/automation","owner":"ilyaraz","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyaraz/automation","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2653},{"name":"Prashanth-Mallyampatti/LR-WPAN-simulation","owner":"Prashanth-Mallyampatti","html_url":"https://github.com/Prashanth-Mallyampatti/LR-WPAN-simulation","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Multi Node 802.15.4 IEEE LR-WPAN model simulation","topics":[],"score":2653},{"name":"chungmcl/JishoScraper","owner":"chungmcl","html_url":"https://github.com/chungmcl/JishoScraper","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Collection of Python scripts revolving around KanjiScraper.py -- Scrapes Jisho.org for Kanji data to be used in multiple ways for learning Japanese.
