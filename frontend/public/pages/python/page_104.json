is an important aspect today. We wanted to implement this idea to Classrooms and emphasise on the Smart Attendance System. We wrote the code in Python and we used techniques such as Haar-Cascading to detect the trained object (face).  There are 3 steps involved: Training, Testing and Prediction. A persons image will be captured in different light intensities and pose. These images are stored in the database. This is training. When the person faces the camera, his/her images will be verified with that of the trained images in the database. This is testing. The final step is the prediction, which tells us if it is a success ( when there is a match between the image captured and the images in the database) or a failure ( when there is no match between the image captured and the images in the database).","topics":[],"score":2994},{"name":"zaro0508/sceptre-identity-resolver","owner":"zaro0508","html_url":"https://github.com/zaro0508/sceptre-identity-resolver","stars":4,"forks":1,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"A set of Sceptre resolvers to help identify a stack","topics":[],"score":2994},{"name":"uw-it-aca/uw-restclients-sws","owner":"uw-it-aca","html_url":"https://github.com/uw-it-aca/uw-restclients-sws","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":2,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2994},{"name":"tedrick/SyncSurvey","owner":"tedrick","html_url":"https://github.com/tedrick/SyncSurvey","stars":18,"forks":5,"issues":9,"language":"Python","description":"Synchronize a Hosted Feature Service to an Enterprise Geodatabase","topics":[],"score":2993},{"name":"zoecarver/grover-arc","owner":"zoecarver","html_url":"https://github.com/zoecarver/grover-arc","stars":10,"forks":1,"issues":2,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2993},{"name":"nirmeshk/Hyper-parameter-Optimization","owner":"nirmeshk","html_url":"https://github.com/nirmeshk/Hyper-parameter-Optimization","stars":8,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"A Repository for optimizing the hyper parameters of Genetic Algorithm ","topics":[],"score":2993},{"name":"cmtoomey/TableauConference2017","owner":"cmtoomey","html_url":"https://github.com/cmtoomey/TableauConference2017","stars":6,"forks":3,"issues":51,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2992},{"name":"abhaybd/Fleet-AI","owner":"abhaybd","html_url":"https://github.com/abhaybd/Fleet-AI","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Using Reinforcement Learning to play Battleship","topics":["battleship","battleship-game","deep-reinforcement-learning","ppo","pytorch","react","reactjs","reinforcement-learning"],"score":2992},{"name":"philip-zhan/decentralized-social-network","owner":"philip-zhan","html_url":"https://github.com/philip-zhan/decentralized-social-network","stars":5,"forks":3,"issues":8,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2992},{"name":"kheimerl/libvbts","owner":"kheimerl","html_url":"https://github.com/kheimerl/libvbts","stars":4,"forks":10,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Scripts supporting the VBTS project at UCBerkeley; a community-scale cellular tower.
