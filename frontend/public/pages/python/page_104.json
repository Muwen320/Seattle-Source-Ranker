We wanted to implement this idea to Classrooms and emphasise on the Smart Attendance System. We wrote the code in Python and we used techniques such as Haar-Cascading to detect the trained object (face).  There are 3 steps involved: Training, Testing and Prediction. A persons image will be captured in different light intensities and pose. These images are stored in the database. This is training. When the person faces the camera, his/her images will be verified with that of the trained images in the database. This is testing. The final step is the prediction, which tells us if it is a success ( when there is a match between the image captured and the images in the database) or a failure ( when there is no match between the image captured and the images in the database).","topics":[],"score":2894,"global_rank":25938},{"name":"seomoz/elasticsearch-utils","owner":"seomoz","html_url":"https://github.com/seomoz/elasticsearch-utils","stars":3,"forks":1,"watchers":109,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"Some elasticsearch utilities I've put together / been using in investigating elasticsearch performance","topics":[],"score":2894,"global_rank":25944},{"name":"Cody-Calhoun/dojo_reads","owner":"Cody-Calhoun","html_url":"https://github.com/Cody-Calhoun/dojo_reads","stars":3,"forks":1,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2894,"global_rank":25946},{"name":"caelan/ss","owner":"caelan","html_url":"https://github.com/caelan/ss","stars":3,"forks":2,"watchers":2,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Lightweight implementation of stripstream with support for functions","topics":["pddl","planning-algorithms","robotics","strips"],"score":2894,"global_rank":25948},{"name":"jaxxstorm/pulumi-do","owner":"jaxxstorm","html_url":"https://github.com/jaxxstorm/pulumi-do","stars":3,"forks":0,"watchers":2,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"A Digital Ocean (DO) Pulumi resource package, providing multi-language access to Digital Ocean","topics":[],"score":2894,"global_rank":25950}]
