We wanted to implement this idea to Classrooms and emphasise on the Smart Attendance System. We wrote the code in Python and we used techniques such as Haar-Cascading to detect the trained object (face).  There are 3 steps involved: Training, Testing and Prediction. A persons image will be captured in different light intensities and pose. These images are stored in the database. This is training. When the person faces the camera, his/her images will be verified with that of the trained images in the database. This is testing. The final step is the prediction, which tells us if it is a success ( when there is a match between the image captured and the images in the database) or a failure ( when there is no match between the image captured and the images in the database).","topics":[],"score":2993,"global_rank":26649},{"name":"zaro0508/sceptre-identity-resolver","owner":"zaro0508","html_url":"https://github.com/zaro0508/sceptre-identity-resolver","stars":4,"forks":1,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"A set of Sceptre resolvers to help identify a stack","topics":[],"score":2993,"global_rank":26652},{"name":"Sage-Bionetworks/streamlit-snowflake-template","owner":"Sage-Bionetworks","html_url":"https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/streamlit-snowflake-template","stars":2,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2993,"global_rank":26658},{"name":"JohnTortugo/truffle-logs-analyzer","owner":"JohnTortugo","html_url":"https://github.com/JohnTortugo/truffle-logs-analyzer","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Utility tool to parse & analyze GraalVM Truffle engine logs","topics":[],"score":2993,"global_rank":26660},{"name":"nirmeshk/Hyper-parameter-Optimization","owner":"nirmeshk","html_url":"https://github.com/nirmeshk/Hyper-parameter-Optimization","stars":8,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"A Repository for optimizing the hyper parameters of Genetic Algorithm ","topics":[],"score":2992,"global_rank":26667},{"name":"abhaybd/Fleet-AI","owner":"abhaybd","html_url":"https://github.com/abhaybd/Fleet-AI","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Using Reinforcement Learning to play Battleship","topics":["battleship","battleship-game","deep-reinforcement-learning","ppo","pytorch","react","reactjs","reinforcement-learning"],"score":2992,"global_rank":26677},{"name":"philip-zhan/decentralized-social-network","owner":"philip-zhan","html_url":"https://github.com/philip-zhan/decentralized-social-network","stars":5,"forks":3,"issues":8,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2992,"global_rank":26678},{"name":"Talamantez/video-translator","owner":"Talamantez","html_url":"https://github.com/Talamantez/video-translator","stars":4,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Use OCR, Object Recognition, Audio Recognition, and Machine Translation to understand foreign news","topics":[],"score":2992,"global_rank":26682},{"name":"viv-r/asset-allocation","owner":"viv-r","html_url":"https://github.com/viv-r/asset-allocation","stars":3,"forks":5,"issues":7,"language":"Python","description":"Visualizing the risk vs reward for various investment portfolios","topics":["dash","finance","investment-analysis","plotly","vizualisation"],"score":2992,"global_rank":26688},{"name":"Toylerrr/GameVault-Snake-Edition","owner":"Toylerrr","html_url":"https://github.com/Toylerrr/GameVault-Snake-Edition","stars":2,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2992,"global_rank":26697},{"name":"kheimerl/libvbts","owner":"kheimerl","html_url":"https://github.com/kheimerl/libvbts","stars":4,"forks":10,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Scripts supporting the VBTS project at UCBerkeley; a community-scale cellular tower.
