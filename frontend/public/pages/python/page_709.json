It is the 12th most populous place in the US. With high population comes the need to have houses in the area. Therefore, I started working on prediction of house prices in the county region. For the problem, I have done a comparitive analysis between Ridge regression and least square regression, and I found that the Ridge Regression improved the model in terms of accuracy and stability.
