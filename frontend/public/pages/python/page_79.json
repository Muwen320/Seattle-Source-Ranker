Market segmentation divides a broad target market into subsets of consumers or businesses that have or are perceived to have common needs, interests, and priorities. These segments help firms or businesses focus on their target groups effectively and allocate resources efficiently. Traditional segmentation methods are solely based on attribute data such as demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, education, etc.) and psychographic profiles (lifestyle, personality, motives, etc.). However, social networks have recently become important for marketing. Depending on the nature of the market, social relations can even become vital in forming segments. Such social relations combined with demographic properties can be used to find more relevant subsets of consumers or businesses (i.e., communities).","score":3221},{"name":"mcbridejc/monitor_rtl433","owner":"mcbridejc","html_url":"https://github.com/mcbridejc/monitor_rtl433","stars":5,"forks":2,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"wireless sensor monitor and prometheus gateway using rtl_433","score":3221},{"name":"FredHutch/sci-pkg","owner":"FredHutch","html_url":"https://github.com/FredHutch/sci-pkg","stars":5,"forks":3,"issues":3,"language":"Python","description":"a loose collection of functions used in Scientific Computing put into a python package ","score":3221},{"name":"InstituteforDiseaseModeling/laser-cholera","owner":"InstituteforDiseaseModeling","html_url":"https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/laser-cholera","stars":2,"forks":1,"issues":4,"language":"Python","description":"\"LASIK\" - LASER based SImulation of Kolera","score":3221},{"name":"tmick0/alesisvsysex","owner":"tmick0","html_url":"https://github.com/tmick0/alesisvsysex","stars":17,"forks":7,"issues":7,"language":"Python","description":"Python tool for configuring Alesis V-Series MIDI controllers","score":3220},{"name":"jaflo/screenStitch","owner":"jaflo","html_url":"https://github.com/jaflo/screenStitch","stars":12,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Analyses screenshots to stitch together a long image","score":3220},{"name":"faizann24/fbot-bot-that-teaches-hacking-and-security","owner":"faizann24","html_url":"https://github.com/faizann24/fbot-bot-that-teaches-hacking-and-security","stars":8,"forks":4,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"A chat bot that teaches you stuff about hacking and security.","score":3220},{"name":"HenryPengZou/DeCrisisMB","owner":"HenryPengZou","html_url":"https://github.com/HenryPengZou/DeCrisisMB","stars":6,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"[EMNLP 2023] Official Code of \"DeCrisisMB: Debiased Semi-Supervised Learning for Crisis Tweet Classification via Memory Bank\"","score":3220},{"name":"felipefrr/mpa_splc","owner":"felipefrr","html_url":"https://github.com/felipefrr/mpa_splc","stars":5,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Main Path Analysis (MPA) with Search Path Link Count (SPLC).","score":3220},{"name":"chen0040/keras-image-to-image","owner":"chen0040","html_url":"https://github.com/chen0040/keras-image-to-image","stars":4,"forks":6,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"Transform one image to another image in Keras using GAN","score":3220}]
