These segments help firms or businesses focus on their target groups effectively and allocate resources efficiently. Traditional segmentation methods are solely based on attribute data such as demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, education, etc.) and psychographic profiles (lifestyle, personality, motives, etc.). However, social networks have recently become important for marketing. Depending on the nature of the market, social relations can even become vital in forming segments. Such social relations combined with demographic properties can be used to find more relevant subsets of consumers or businesses (i.e., communities).","topics":[],"score":3219,"global_rank":19259},{"name":"jmew/Exacto","owner":"jmew","html_url":"https://github.com/jmew/Exacto","stars":5,"forks":4,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"A tool to do foreground extraction of images","topics":[],"score":3219,"global_rank":19263},{"name":"uwdb/visualroad","owner":"uwdb","html_url":"https://github.com/uwdb/visualroad","stars":12,"forks":10,"issues":7,"language":"Python","description":"Visual Road: A Video Data Management Benchmark","topics":[],"score":3218,"global_rank":19279},{"name":"goopypanther/webtoon-dl.py","owner":"goopypanther","html_url":"https://github.com/goopypanther/webtoon-dl.py","stars":11,"forks":10,"issues":5,"language":"Python","description":"Webtoons.com downloader","topics":[],"score":3218,"global_rank":19282},{"name":"haynec/los_guidance","owner":"haynec","html_url":"https://github.com/haynec/los_guidance","stars":8,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":3218,"global_rank":19286},{"name":"FredHutch/batch_pipeline","owner":"FredHutch","html_url":"https://github.com/FredHutch/batch_pipeline","stars":8,"forks":4,"issues":8,"language":"Python","description":"Example workflows for a multi-step array job on AWS Batch","topics":[],"score":3218,"global_rank":19288},{"name":"faizann24/fbot-bot-that-teaches-hacking-and-security","owner":"faizann24","html_url":"https://github.com/faizann24/fbot-bot-that-teaches-hacking-and-security","stars":8,"forks":4,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"A chat bot that teaches you stuff about hacking and security.","topics":[],"score":3218,"global_rank":19290},{"name":"f5devcentral/f5-big-iq-trial-quick-start","owner":"f5devcentral","html_url":"https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-big-iq-trial-quick-start","stars":4,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Use this when trialing BIG-IQ Centralized Management ","topics":[],"score":3218,"global_rank":19299},{"name":"uwdata/draco-learn","owner":"uwdata","html_url":"https://github.com/uwdata/draco-learn","stars":4,"forks":5,"issues":2,"language":"Python","description":"Learning Weights for Draco","topics":[],"score":3218,"global_rank":19302},{"name":"generalui/multi-agent-dev-team","owner":"generalui","html_url":"https://github.com/generalui/multi-agent-dev-team","stars":3,"forks":4,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":3218,"global_rank":19304},{"name":"AllenInstitute/deepinterpolation_paper","owner":"AllenInstitute","html_url":"https://github.com/AllenInstitute/deepinterpolation_paper","stars":3,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":3218,"global_rank":19305},{"name":"progwriter/SOL","owner":"progwriter","html_url":"https://github.com/progwriter/SOL","stars":22,"forks":11,"issues":5,"language":"Python","description":"SOL: SDN optimization layer.
