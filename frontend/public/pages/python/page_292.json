If  is already a palindrome or no such character exists, then print . There will always be a valid solution, and any correct answer is acceptable. For example, if  \"bcbc\", we can either remove 'b' at index  or 'c' at index .  Input Format  The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of test cases.  Each line  of the  subsequent lines (where ) describes a test case in the form of a single string, .  Constraints  All characters are lowercase English letters.
