This platform will be available through a browser and an app. To make this possible we will need to build a strong backend so that we don\u2019t have to do any redundant work for the app and site. We can use Google App Engine to manage much of the back end of our service. As for the front end, the front end can be written in JavaScript using ReactNative and Expo to make the apps, and simply JavaScript for the website. Security will be essential for this platform so we will need to use a secure login service.
