For this image classification task we used an image classification application using a deep learning model called a convolutional neural network (often abbreviated as CNN). CNNs work particularly well for detecting features in images like colors, textures, and edges; then using these features to identify objects in the images. I used a CNN that has already learned the features from a giant dataset of 1.2 million images called ImageNet. There are different types of CNNs that have different structures (architectures) that work better or worse depending on your criteria. With this project you'll explore the three different architectures (AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet).","topics":[],"score":2632},{"name":"rhroberts/parktools","owner":"rhroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/rhroberts/parktools","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Python tools for the ballpark","topics":[],"score":2632},{"name":"TheNicGard/DungeonStar","owner":"TheNicGard","html_url":"https://github.com/TheNicGard/DungeonStar","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Fantasy roguelike based off of TStand90's Roguelike Tutorial Revised.","topics":[],"score":2632},{"name":"KevinPan2021/Text-Completion-GPT","owner":"KevinPan2021","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinPan2021/Text-Completion-GPT","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Text Generation using GPT2 with pytorch (GUI included)","topics":[],"score":2632},{"name":"RoryBarnes/Covid2Uly","owner":"RoryBarnes","html_url":"https://github.com/RoryBarnes/Covid2Uly","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2632},{"name":"jmnorma/Productivity_Analytics","owner":"jmnorma","html_url":"https://github.com/jmnorma/Productivity_Analytics","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Mini-Project 2 for CPSC 4720 ","topics":["kivy","matplotlib","productivity"],"score":2632},{"name":"dmalyuta/ecolint_rocket_landing","owner":"dmalyuta","html_url":"https://github.com/dmalyuta/ecolint_rocket_landing","stars":1,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"1D rocket soft landing optimization and control problem, for my presentation at Ecolint","topics":[],"score":2632},{"name":"magoulet/gold-alert","owner":"magoulet","html_url":"https://github.com/magoulet/gold-alert","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2632},{"name":"PeppyHare/aa545","owner":"PeppyHare","html_url":"https://github.com/PeppyHare/aa545","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2632},{"name":"dd292/Robofly_simulator","owner":"dd292","html_url":"https://github.com/dd292/Robofly_simulator","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2632},{"name":"FowlerLab/starcall-workflow","owner":"FowlerLab","html_url":"https://github.com/FowlerLab/starcall-workflow","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"A snakemake pipeline for the processing of in situ sequencing data.
