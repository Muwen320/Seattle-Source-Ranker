Each stone is also called a Pichu. Initially the board starts empty, except for two rows of white Pichus on the second and third row of the board, and two rows of black Pichus on rows n \u2212 2 and n \u2212 1. Two players alternate turns, with White going first. When a Pichu reaches the opposite side of the board (i.e. when a Black Pichu reaches row 1 or a white Pichu reaches row n), then the Pichu is marked with an X and becomes a Pikachu.","score":2490},{"name":"WolffM/mtgProxyPrint","owner":"WolffM","html_url":"https://github.com/WolffM/mtgProxyPrint","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"score":2490},{"name":"WolffM/imgCropTool","owner":"WolffM","html_url":"https://github.com/WolffM/imgCropTool","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"score":2490},{"name":"AllenInstitute/modular-networks-theory","owner":"AllenInstitute","html_url":"https://github.com/AllenInstitute/modular-networks-theory","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"score":2490},{"name":"TrofimovAssya/TCRome","owner":"TrofimovAssya","html_url":"https://github.com/TrofimovAssya/TCRome","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"latent
