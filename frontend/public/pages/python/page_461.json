When a user performs a query, an ad request is placed online and a group of advertisers can then bid for that advertisement slot. The bid of advertiser i for ad request q is denoted as bi q. We assume that the bids are small with respect to the daily budgets of the advertisers (i.e, for each i and q, b iq << Bi ) . Moreover, each advertisement slot can be allocated to at most one advertiser and the advertiser is charged his bid from his budget. The objective is to maximize the amount of money received from the advertisers","topics":[],"score":2199},{"name":"davidthaler/ensemble_amazon","owner":"davidthaler","html_url":"https://github.com/davidthaler/ensemble_amazon","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Extensive reworking of model stacking code from kazAnova/ensemble_amazon","topics":[],"score":2199},{"name":"TransientObject/document_classifier","owner":"TransientObject","html_url":"https://github.com/TransientObject/document_classifier","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2199},{"name":"huiqingao/divination","owner":"huiqingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huiqingao/divination","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2199},{"name":"matthewd673/flurries","owner":"matthewd673","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewd673/flurries","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"external debug log","topics":[],"score":2199},{"name":"OREdwardsJr/youtube-series","owner":"OREdwardsJr","html_url":"https://github.com/OREdwardsJr/youtube-series","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Tutorials and exercises associated with videos found on my youtube channel.","topics":[],"score":2199},{"name":"nikitadaharia/IntroToProg-Python","owner":"nikitadaharia","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitadaharia/IntroToProg-Python","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"This Rep. will be used to review homework files","topics":[],"score":2199},{"name":"realzza/video-animator","owner":"realzza","html_url":"https://github.com/realzza/video-animator","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2199},{"name":"jradavenport/setinews_script","owner":"jradavenport","html_url":"https://github.com/jradavenport/setinews_script","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"scripts to automate the creation of the SETI.news emails and website","topics":[],"score":2199},{"name":"masq/CTI-Tools","owner":"masq","html_url":"https://github.com/masq/CTI-Tools","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"A collection of handy scripts/tools I built for CTI purposes.","topics":[],"score":2199},{"name":"sethdmay/cats.ai","owner":"sethdmay","html_url":"https://github.com/sethdmay/cats.ai","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Computer vision Accuracy Trainer for Sports -
