The tablet servers support garbage collection (only keep the last five inserted values), maintaining the memtable for effective searching (memtable would spilled to disk when there are a hundred unique row keys exists), maintaining the in-memory indexes, sharding when a table contains more than 1000 row keys, WAL, reconstructing the tablet server state using WAL and SSTables maintained in the
