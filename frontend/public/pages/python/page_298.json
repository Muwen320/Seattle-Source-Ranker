If  is already a palindrome or no such character exists, then print . There will always be a valid solution, and any correct answer is acceptable. For example, if  \"bcbc\", we can either remove 'b' at index  or 'c' at index .  Input Format  The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of test cases.  Each line  of the  subsequent lines (where ) describes a test case in the form of a single string, .  Constraints  All characters are lowercase English letters. Output Format  Print an integer denoting the zero-indexed position of the character that makes  not a palindrome; if  is already a palindrome or no such character exists, print .  Sample Input  3 aaab baa aaa Sample Output  3 0 -1 Explanation  Test Case 1: \"aaab\"  Removing 'b' at index  results in a palindrome, so we print  on a new line.  Test Case 2: \"baa\"  Removing 'b' at index  results in a palindrome, so we print  on a new line.
