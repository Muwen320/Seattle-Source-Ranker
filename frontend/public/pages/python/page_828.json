The scenario: A spy deleted important files from a computer. There were a few witnesses at the scene of the crime, but no one is sure who exactly the spy was. Three possible suspects were apprehended based on surveillance video. Each suspect had a sample of DNA taken from them. The computer's keyboard was also swabbed for DNA evidence and, luckily, one small DNA sample was successfully retrieved from the computer's keyboard.  Given the three suspects' DNA and the sample DNA retreived from the keyboard, it's up to you to figure out who the spy is!  The project should have methods for each of the following:  Given a file, read in the DNA for each suspect and save it as a string Take a DNA string and split it into a list of codons Iterate through a suspect's codon list to see how many of their codons match the sample codons. Pick the right suspect to continue the investigation on. My thoughts - 3 codons is not nearly enough to match DNA samples... but, regardless, here is the program:","topics":[],"score":2075,"global_rank":322602},{"name":"kmussar/Bank_Account_CodeAcademy","owner":"kmussar","html_url":"https://github.com/kmussar/Bank_Account_CodeAcademy","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"This is a simple excercise demonstrating classes and objects.
