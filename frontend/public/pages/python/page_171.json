In a distributed system, data replication ensures reliability and availability among nodes: if one or more servers fail, the system can still function properly even though the node which contains the write is not available. The performance of the system can also be improved due to lower access time and higher scalability; we can reduce response time as the data can be acquired locally, and the system can scale better as requests can be serviced by multiple servers instead of one.","topics":[],"score":2653},{"name":"hanseaston/stock-prediction-project","owner":"hanseaston","html_url":"https://github.com/hanseaston/stock-prediction-project","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2653},{"name":"GHowlett/telegram-mirror","owner":"GHowlett","html_url":"https://github.com/GHowlett/telegram-mirror","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":1,"language":"Python","description":"Mirror a telegram chat","topics":[],"score":2653},{"name":"concavegit/ekf-slam-lidar","owner":"concavegit","html_url":"https://github.com/concavegit/ekf-slam-lidar","stars":1,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"A repo to explore visual odometry and perhaps monocular SLAM","topics":[],"score":2653},{"name":"creachadair/eyepopper","owner":"creachadair","html_url":"https://github.com/creachadair/eyepopper","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"A local POP3 implementation that provides a read-only view of a collection of Unix mailbox files or Maildir directories.","topics":[],"score":2653},{"name":"matthewSorensen/pewpew","owner":"matthewSorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewSorensen/pewpew","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"General CNC firmware for teensy 4.x controllers.","topics":[],"score":2653},{"name":"mgmeyers/markdown-auto-tagger","owner":"mgmeyers","html_url":"https://github.com/mgmeyers/markdown-auto-tagger","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2653},{"name":"katelouie/starlight","owner":"katelouie","html_url":"https://github.com/katelouie/starlight","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"A Python computational astrology package.","topics":["astrology","natal-chart","planets","swissephemeris"],"score":2653},{"name":"KaylaNguyen/Nonogram-Solver","owner":"KaylaNguyen","html_url":"https://github.com/KaylaNguyen/Nonogram-Solver","stars":2,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Nonogram solver using Genetic Algorithm and Constraint Satisfaction","topics":[],"score":2652},{"name":"chungmcl/JishoScraper","owner":"chungmcl","html_url":"https://github.com/chungmcl/JishoScraper","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Collection of Python scripts revolving around KanjiScraper.py -- Scrapes Jisho.org for Kanji data to be used in multiple ways for learning Japanese.
