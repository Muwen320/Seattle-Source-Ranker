When a user performs a query, an ad request is placed online and a group of advertisers can then bid for that advertisement slot. The bid of advertiser i for ad request q is denoted as bi q. We assume that the bids are small with respect to the daily budgets of the advertisers (i.e, for each i and q, b iq << Bi ) . Moreover, each advertisement slot can be allocated to at most one advertiser and the advertiser is charged his bid from his budget.
