It adds extra features to the route planning software like Yahoo Maps, Google Maps. Imagine planning a trip in an unfamiliar city, and having the advice of those who live in the city at your disposal. Once you have a route you think looks reasonable, you can ask to see what others have to say about that route. We believe that the individuals who live and travel in a city can be a fountain of useful information, so they can use their knowledge to help others. Considering this we are planning to deploy that knowledge and extend the capability of maps with user supplied advices.","topics":[],"score":2335},{"name":"ecuddihy/wlux_temp_book","owner":"ecuddihy","html_url":"https://github.com/ecuddihy/wlux_temp_book","stars":1,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"PHP","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2335},{"name":"9ete/wp-multisite-internal-sso","owner":"9ete","html_url":"https://github.com/9ete/wp-multisite-internal-sso","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":1,"language":"PHP","description":"WordPress Multisite plugin that allows users to access other sites on the network w/o login if they have an auth session on the primary site and belong to the secondary.","topics":[],"score":2335},{"name":"markjm/CBO-Simplifier","owner":"markjm","html_url":"https://github.com/markjm/CBO-Simplifier","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"PHP","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2334},{"name":"maxrandolph/SuiteCRM-API-Wrapper","owner":"maxrandolph","html_url":"https://github.com/maxrandolph/SuiteCRM-API-Wrapper","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"PHP","description":"A custom API wrapper for SuiteCRM.
