In this game (which is played on the command-line), the player populates an ant colony with the bravest ants they can muster. The ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade their territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath!","score":1877},{"name":"wtfribley/angular-webpack-seedling","owner":"wtfribley","html_url":"https://github.com/wtfribley/angular-webpack-seedling","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"An Angular seed with a focus on documentation, simplicity and ease of use.","score":1877},{"name":"stevenvelozo/dropbag","owner":"stevenvelozo","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenvelozo/dropbag","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"Simple HTTP-based file storage with different persistence options","score":1877},{"name":"meeksfred/random-practice-problems","owner":"meeksfred","html_url":"https://github.com/meeksfred/random-practice-problems","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"A collection of random mathematical/coding problems","score":1877},{"name":"meeksfred/exercism-solutions","owner":"meeksfred","html_url":"https://github.com/meeksfred/exercism-solutions","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"Practice JS problems from Exercism","score":1877},{"name":"minjie128/battleship-game","owner":"minjie128","html_url":"https://github.com/minjie128/battleship-game","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":null,"score":1877},{"name":"RowiDont/trump-stats","owner":"RowiDont","html_url":"https://github.com/RowiDont/trump-stats","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":null,"score":1877},{"name":"brisourceful/About-Me","owner":"brisourceful","html_url":"https://github.com/brisourceful/About-Me","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"This is an 'About Me' guessing game with questions.","score":1877},{"name":"madeleinehuish/elanvitalwork","owner":"madeleinehuish","html_url":"https://github.com/madeleinehuish/elanvitalwork","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":null,"score":1877},{"name":"48ca/shoegaze","owner":"48ca","html_url":"https://github.com/48ca/shoegaze","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"JavaScript","description":"Relaxation at its finest","score":1877},{"name":"kpsuperplane/hack-the-north-platform-challenge","owner":"kpsuperplane","html_url":"https://github.com/kpsuperplane/hack-the-north-platform-challenge","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"Platform Challenge for Hack the North 2017 Team Applications","score":1877},{"name":"boetw/if-you-cant-say-anything-nice","owner":"boetw","html_url":"https://github.com/boetw/if-you-cant-say-anything-nice","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":null,"score":1877},{"name":"boetw/angularThing","owner":"boetw","html_url":"https://github.com/boetw/angularThing","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":null,"score":1877},{"name":"jinkwon14/Ag2-OfficialTutorial","owner":"jinkwon14","html_url":"https://github.com/jinkwon14/Ag2-OfficialTutorial","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":null,"score":1877},{"name":"mmarston/jcreate","owner":"mmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/mmarston/jcreate","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"A simple DOM element creation library.","score":1877},{"name":"seattletimes/refugee-history-graph-2017","owner":"seattletimes","html_url":"https://github.com/seattletimes/refugee-history-graph-2017","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"Where do Washington's refugees come from?","score":1877},{"name":"shirleyhxm/UCLA-CS174A","owner":"shirleyhxm","html_url":"https://github.com/shirleyhxm/UCLA-CS174A","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"Winter 2017 Computer Graphics","score":1877},{"name":"manasisharma/fd-api","owner":"manasisharma","html_url":"https://github.com/manasisharma/fd-api","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":2,"language":"JavaScript","description":"Node.js API - Delivering content to server outside through various levels of security. #filetransfer","score":1877},{"name":"Bonanashelby/About-Me-1","owner":"Bonanashelby","html_url":"https://github.com/Bonanashelby/About-Me-1","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"This is an about me guessing game!
