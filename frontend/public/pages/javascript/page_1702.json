Integration of the developed messaging application with a Buffer space (Kafka message Queue) that increases the durability of the stored messages in cases of complete memory consumption and network partition.  Integrating a durable messaging system which allows the separation of concerns between scaling and database (Database independent message queueing).  Kafka ensures message delivery at least once (Delivery guarantee). Message offsets that help consumers (The Backend Spring Boot Application here) track the point till which messages have been consumed from the Kafka queue.   Deployment of the messaging application with the Kafka broker to the cloud (AWS) where replicated instances are maintained which are served with Elastic Load Balancers to forward requests fairly.
