The game is also known as The Jungle Game, Jungle Chess, or Animals Chess, and is sometimes called Oriental Chess or Children's Chess.  Jungle is a two-player strategy game and has been cited as resembling the Western game Stratego,[1] but Stratego actually has more in common with another Chinese board game known as Jun Qi (Chinese: \u8ecd\u68cb) or \"Army Game\".","topics":[],"score":2155,"global_rank":256535},{"name":"andybangs/cs-js","owner":"andybangs","html_url":"https://github.com/andybangs/cs-js","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2155,"global_rank":256538},{"name":"saibaba/springmvc-clojure","owner":"saibaba","html_url":"https://github.com/saibaba/springmvc-clojure","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"Writing
