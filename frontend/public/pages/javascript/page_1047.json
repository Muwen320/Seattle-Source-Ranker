You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings. The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau, but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.
