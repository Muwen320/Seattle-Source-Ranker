It uses three concepts already on the market: Patterns, Anti-Patterns and Personas - structures called in this work as APPP. While the three concepts mentioned are already known and implemented by professionals in the area, the technique proposed by this work stands out especially by the relationship between them, an aggregation of the benefits of each concept in favor of another one. The technique aims to support the developers through the documentation of good and bad practices in software development. Documenting recurring problems and solutions, minimizes the time it is used in an effort to issue already resolved. It is common knowledge that many solutions as well as good and bad practices can be properly documented - as it\u2019s currently done through Patterns and Anti-Patterns - however, this technique through the documentation may be directed to one or more users profile: Personas. Seeking to sustain the viability and effectiveness of this proposal, the work also presents a tool that enables designers and developers to manage the whole process of creation, research, application and validation of APPP structures and their relationships. The tool can also in future be adapted to receive the structures APPP automatically, for example, through RBC - Reasoning Based on Cases - for a better autonomy in the provision of resources for a good software development.     Key-words: Patterns, Anti-Patterns, Personas, Picaps.","topics":[],"score":2303,"global_rank":105970},{"name":"vlandham/chrisandemmy","owner":"vlandham","html_url":"https://github.com/vlandham/chrisandemmy","stars":1,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"wedding
