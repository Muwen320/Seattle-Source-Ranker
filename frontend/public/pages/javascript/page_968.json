With every letter guess, the letter will be displayed along with the previous letter guesses. Incorrect guesses will slowly build the scaffolding, noose, and sections of the hanged man's body (by swapping out images) until all ten guesses are used up. The game will 'reveal' correct letters as they are guessed (by replacing asterisks *), keep track of the number of guesses used, as well as the number of guesses remaining. It will provide the user with the name of the secret word if he-or-she fails to correctly guess it.","score":2195},{"name":"fabricekalvanda/washingtonGuessingGame","owner":"fabricekalvanda","html_url":"https://github.com/fabricekalvanda/washingtonGuessingGame","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"The Cities of Washington State Guessing Game allows the user to make five guesses to name a city in Washington, while also giving three hints: the first letter in the city, the last letter of the city, and the number of letters in the city.
