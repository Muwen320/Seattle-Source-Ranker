I was inspired to create this by the pc game \"Kenshi\". The goal was to create an algorithm whereby an inventory would autosort itself to create space for any new item a user attempted to place with that inventory. After attempting to deduce a method independently, I checked the available pre-existing methods, and found that my solution resembles the \u201cguillotine heuristic\u201d.
