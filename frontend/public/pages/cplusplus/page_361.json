We had created our own assembly rules and code for our CPU. We did code the entire project in \"C\".  The initial phase consisted of created all the registers, ALU ,control unit and all the flags required. Later we designed the arithmetic unit and the logic. Later the controls and the loop we designed which work for the assembly function we wrote.By the end of all phase the CPU could compute basic functionalities.
