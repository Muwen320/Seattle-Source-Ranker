You will know many basic data structures, algorithms, and the tradeoffs among memory, running time, and implementation time associated with them. Topics include: data abstraction, mathematical induction, propositions quantifiers, proofs, recursion, computational complexity and algorithm analysis, linked lists, stacks, queues, searching and sorting, and object-oriented methods.","topics":[],"score":2510},{"name":"vatsalcode/CodeForces_Sol","owner":"vatsalcode","html_url":"https://github.com/vatsalcode/CodeForces_Sol","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2510},{"name":"vatsalcode/Balanced_Array_GFG","owner":"vatsalcode","html_url":"https://github.com/vatsalcode/Balanced_Array_GFG","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Question link-https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/balanced-array07200720/1/?category[]=Arrays&difficulty[]=-1&difficulty[]=0&page=1&query=category[]Arraysdifficulty[]-1difficulty[]0page1","topics":[],"score":2510},{"name":"Dillonb/rsp-recorder","owner":"Dillonb","html_url":"https://github.com/Dillonb/rsp-recorder","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2510},{"name":"rhettg/stubborn","owner":"rhettg","html_url":"https://github.com/rhettg/stubborn","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A rover","topics":[],"score":2510},{"name":"tonymuu/gossip-style-failure-detector","owner":"tonymuu","html_url":"https://github.com/tonymuu/gossip-style-failure-detector","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"My implementation for a gossip style failure detector, for CS425 Distributed System@UIUC","topics":[],"score":2510},{"name":"jmarcoares98/CS460","owner":"jmarcoares98","html_url":"https://github.com/jmarcoares98/CS460","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"CS 460 at Washington State University","topics":[],"score":2510},{"name":"davidpluseipi/trey","owner":"davidpluseipi","html_url":"https://github.com/davidpluseipi/trey","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2510},{"name":"megakun/System-programming-","owner":"megakun","html_url":"https://github.com/megakun/System-programming-","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2510},{"name":"johnedquinn/bminor","owner":"johnedquinn","html_url":"https://github.com/johnedquinn/bminor","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"A strictly-typed C-like language called B-Minor.
