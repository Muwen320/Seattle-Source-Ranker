It comes from years of experience working with ASP, but is not quite complete. As of release 4, the library also includes a number of server-side and client-side javascript libraries. Due to numerous limitations in the compilers that come with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.x, this code only works with the updated compilers from MSVC++ 7.0 (.NET). These can be downloaded for free from Microsoft. It also requires the ATL library that comes with MSVC 7. This project is mostly useless these days, as few people code ASP with COM and ActiveX anymore.","score":2142},{"name":"7andrew7/membench","owner":"7andrew7","html_url":"https://github.com/7andrew7/membench","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"score":2142},{"name":"jhgrins/Raytracer","owner":"jhgrins","html_url":"https://github.com/jhgrins/Raytracer","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Raytracing engine used to create gifs","score":2142},{"name":"telemething/MFuse","owner":"telemething","html_url":"https://github.com/telemething/MFuse","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Mulispectral Multimodal On-Line Image Fusion","score":2142},{"name":"JamesPRobertson/LinkedChar","owner":"JamesPRobertson","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesPRobertson/LinkedChar","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"score":2142},{"name":"JamesPRobertson/CSProjectOne","owner":"JamesPRobertson","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesPRobertson/CSProjectOne","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"score":2142},{"name":"bhuvankaruturi/Dash-Unix-Terminal","owner":"bhuvankaruturi","html_url":"https://github.com/bhuvankaruturi/Dash-Unix-Terminal","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Source code of Dallas Shell, a Unix terminal","score":2142},{"name":"phbradley/repdist","owner":"phbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/phbradley/repdist","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Software for comparing T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires","score":2142},{"name":"sarahgrace/cppcon2019","owner":"sarahgrace","html_url":"https://github.com/sarahgrace/cppcon2019","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"score":2142},{"name":"aspk74/OS","owner":"aspk74","html_url":"https://github.com/aspk74/OS","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"score":2142},{"name":"Pr0methean/dieharder","owner":"Pr0methean","html_url":"https://github.com/Pr0methean/dieharder","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Fork of https://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php for developing patches","score":2142},{"name":"chanwkimlab/breakout_game","owner":"chanwkimlab","html_url":"https://github.com/chanwkimlab/breakout_game","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"score":2142},{"name":"dumax315/STM32f4USBRubberDucky","owner":"dumax315","html_url":"https://github.com/dumax315/STM32f4USBRubberDucky","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"score":2142},{"name":"calebwatters/UnrealStealthGame","owner":"calebwatters","html_url":"https://github.com/calebwatters/UnrealStealthGame","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"score":2142},{"name":"gbordelon/fast_ray_tracer","owner":"gbordelon","html_url":"https://github.com/gbordelon/fast_ray_tracer","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Ray Tracer","score":2142},{"name":"oogunjob/CS159-Spring-2019","owner":"oogunjob","html_url":"https://github.com/oogunjob/CS159-Spring-2019","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Assignments completed my freshman year from CS159 at Purdue University.
