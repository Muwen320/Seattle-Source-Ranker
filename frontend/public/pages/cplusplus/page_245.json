The game includes five different categories: Historical Events, Inventions, Pop Culture, Computer Science History, and Video Games. A \"sixth category\" is the option to play with cards from all five decks at once.  The player has to try to place all of their cards in the correct chronological order on the table, with a randomly drawn card representing the first event. If the player guesses incorrectly, they must discard their current card and draw a new one.
