Remember, life is not a sprint but a marathon, so is the path to learning and growning.  Keep defining your short term goals (measurable) and strive hard to achieve them. (Eg. Getting better at competitive coding is not a measurable goal but achiving 2000 rating in Codechef is measurable)  Update everyday progress and submit a pull request.  (Optional) Follow 100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag and timely tweet your progress with #100DaysOfCode hashtag.  Try to add detailed description of what you did, add corresponding links, if you solve questions, you can add your codes in the same folder and provid a link in the README (not for active contests).  We start the marathon on January 1, 2020. feel free to add your goals beforehand (they can also be added later).  Benefits Coding will become a daily habit for you.  Every day that you consistently code, you\u2019ll build momentum. That momentum will make it easier for you to learn more advanced topics.  The projects that you\u2019ll build will be small in scope, so by the time you finish, you\u2019ll have completed several of them \u2014 and gained a wide range of experience.  Your GitHub profile will look extremely active. And yes, hiring managers and recruiters do look at these.  You\u2019ll get more comfortable contributing in open soruce. It will become a natural, ordinary thing to do.  You\u2019ll have a pretty good reason to stop procrastinating and start coding every day.  Increase your efficiency by checking your daily progress and analysing it.  Compare your progress with others and surpass your limits in learning each day.  Recognition You will be provided with certificates on successful completiton of 100DaysOfCode. At the end of each month, goodies will be given to the top performers. A big surprise for the overall top performers in 100DaysOfCode. Note: Only the students in MNIT/ IIIT Kota/ NIT UK are elligible for prizes/ certificates.  Pre-requisites Markdown: You need to update your README in Markdown (a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax). No need to learn it you can always refer to the guide or use an online markdown editor.  Basic git Basic knowledge of git and its workflow is a must. If you are not comfortable, feel free to ask for help.  How to participate Fork the repository. In your fork, make a folder by the name of your github account. In your folder, make a file with the name README.md We have also provided a template which you can follow to set up README.md Update the progress in your README and submit a pull request. If you need more clarification, feel free to reach us at telegram.","topics":[],"score":4247},{"name":"thomhastings/mimikatz-en","owner":"thomhastings","html_url":"https://github.com/thomhastings/mimikatz-en","stars":58,"forks":18,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"English language translation of gentilkiwi's early mimikatz release","topics":[],"score":4246},{"name":"azonenberg/voltage-divider-calculator","owner":"azonenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/azonenberg/voltage-divider-calculator","stars":35,"forks":4,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Tool for selecting voltage divider components given constraints and a list of available resistors","topics":[],"score":4246},{"name":"yechengxi/DBG2OLC","owner":"yechengxi","html_url":"https://github.com/yechengxi/DBG2OLC","stars":66,"forks":27,"issues":4,"language":"C++","description":"A genome assembler that reduces the computational time of human genome assembly from 400,000 CPU hours to 2,000 CPU hours, utilizing long erroneous 3GS sequencing reads and short accurate NGS sequencing reads.","topics":[],"score":4244},{"name":"RobJellinghaus/NowSound","owner":"RobJellinghaus","html_url":"https://github.com/RobJellinghaus/NowSound","stars":37,"forks":4,"issues":1,"language":"C++","description":"Low latency audio library for Windows 10, targeted at Unity UWP and desktop apps.","topics":[],"score":4243},{"name":"mbucchia/OpenXR-Layer-Template","owner":"mbucchia","html_url":"https://github.com/mbucchia/OpenXR-Layer-Template","stars":49,"forks":7,"issues":5,"language":"C++","description":"This repository contains the source project for a basic OpenXR API layer template that can be customized easily.","topics":[],"score":4242},{"name":"Pengor/chia-log-analysis","owner":"Pengor","html_url":"https://github.com/Pengor/chia-log-analysis","stars":41,"forks":7,"issues":2,"language":"C++","description":"Parses existing Chia plotter log files and builds a .csv file containing all the important details","topics":["chia-blockchain"],"score":4242},{"name":"PlayFab/PlayFabParty","owner":"PlayFab","html_url":"https://github.com/PlayFab/PlayFabParty","stars":22,"forks":17,"issues":7,"language":"C++","description":"The libraries, headers, and documentation for accessing the PlayFab Party feature.","topics":[],"score":4242},{"name":"mendsley/tinymixer","owner":"mendsley","html_url":"https://github.com/mendsley/tinymixer","stars":63,"forks":12,"issues":1,"language":"C++","description":"A minimal audio mixer for game-like projects","topics":[],"score":4240},{"name":"mdulin2/house-of-muney","owner":"mdulin2","html_url":"https://github.com/mdulin2/house-of-muney","stars":45,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Code execution via corrupting mmap malloc chunks with ASLR bypass","topics":[],"score":4234},{"name":"bdewey/static-libgit2","owner":"bdewey","html_url":"https://github.com/bdewey/static-libgit2","stars":25,"forks":13,"issues":2,"language":"C","description":"Exposes a static XCFramework of libgit2 as a Swift package","topics":[],"score":4232},{"name":"anakryiko/wprof","owner":"anakryiko","html_url":"https://github.com/anakryiko/wprof","stars":17,"forks":4,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"High-performance system-wide BPF-based workload tracer with Perfetto-backed trace visualization.","topics":["bpf","perfetto","performance","tracing"],"score":4230},{"name":"arkady-emelyanov/ExpressLRS-Joystick","owner":"arkady-emelyanov","html_url":"https://github.com/arkady-emelyanov/ExpressLRS-Joystick","stars":12,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"The ExpressLRS Radio as a joystick.
