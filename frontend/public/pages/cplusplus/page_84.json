You will know many basic data structures, algorithms, and the tradeoffs among memory, running time, and implementation time associated with them. Topics include: data abstraction, mathematical induction, propositions quantifiers, proofs, recursion, computational complexity and algorithm analysis, linked lists, stacks, queues, searching and sorting, and object-oriented methods.","score":2511}]
