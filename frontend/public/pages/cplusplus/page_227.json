I was inspired to create this by the pc game \"Kenshi\". The goal was to create an algorithm whereby an inventory would autosort itself to create space for any new item a user attempted to place with that inventory. After attempting to deduce a method independently, I checked the available pre-existing methods, and found that my solution resembles the \u201cguillotine heuristic\u201d.  It currently has a run time of O(\u22c5Height\u22c5Width\u22c5Items2).","topics":[],"score":2152,"global_rank":258869},{"name":"akishore15/arcx","owner":"akishore15","html_url":"https://github.com/akishore15/arcx","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2152,"global_rank":258896},{"name":"ciroque/arduino","owner":"ciroque","html_url":"https://github.com/ciroque/arduino","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A place for Arduino things","topics":[],"score":2152,"global_rank":258902},{"name":"nreynoldson/Langton-s-Ant","owner":"nreynoldson","html_url":"https://github.com/nreynoldson/Langton-s-Ant","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Project for Intro to Programming II - written in C++","topics":[],"score":2152,"global_rank":258920},{"name":"nreynoldson/Text-based-Zoo-Game","owner":"nreynoldson","html_url":"https://github.com/nreynoldson/Text-based-Zoo-Game","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Own a zoo and buy animals - project for intro to programming II .
