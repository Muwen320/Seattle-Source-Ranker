It comes from years of experience working with ASP, but is not quite complete. As of release 4, the library also includes a number of server-side and client-side javascript libraries. Due to numerous limitations in the compilers that come with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.x, this code only works with the updated compilers from MSVC++ 7.0 (.NET). These can be downloaded for free from Microsoft. It also requires the ATL library that comes with MSVC 7. This project is mostly useless these days, as few people code ASP with COM and ActiveX anymore.","topics":["activex","asp","com"],"score":2141},{"name":"sarahgrace/cppcon2019","owner":"sarahgrace","html_url":"https://github.com/sarahgrace/cppcon2019","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2141},{"name":"calebwatters/UnrealStealthGame","owner":"calebwatters","html_url":"https://github.com/calebwatters/UnrealStealthGame","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2141},{"name":"ilyaraz/AESBenchmarking","owner":"ilyaraz","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyaraz/AESBenchmarking","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2141},{"name":"kcarrel/Training-Notes","owner":"kcarrel","html_url":"https://github.com/kcarrel/Training-Notes","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"My notes while reading through How Linux Works and The Linux Command Line","topics":[],"score":2141},{"name":"emef/pisscam","owner":"emef","html_url":"https://github.com/emef/pisscam","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2141},{"name":"JLee21/cpp-elevator","owner":"JLee21","html_url":"https://github.com/JLee21/cpp-elevator","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A multi-threaded C++ project that simulates the control and logic of multiple elevators in a building","topics":[],"score":2141},{"name":"aspk74/OS","owner":"aspk74","html_url":"https://github.com/aspk74/OS","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2141},{"name":"phbradley/repdist","owner":"phbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/phbradley/repdist","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Software for comparing T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires","topics":[],"score":2141},{"name":"JamesPRobertson/LinkedChar","owner":"JamesPRobertson","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesPRobertson/LinkedChar","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2141},{"name":"7andrew7/membench","owner":"7andrew7","html_url":"https://github.com/7andrew7/membench","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2141},{"name":"Pr0methean/dieharder","owner":"Pr0methean","html_url":"https://github.com/Pr0methean/dieharder","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Fork of https://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php for developing patches","topics":[],"score":2141},{"name":"jongminHan/GCDCalculator","owner":"jongminHan","html_url":"https://github.com/jongminHan/GCDCalculator","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2141},{"name":"BluFedora/ZombieBoyLevelEditor","owner":"BluFedora","html_url":"https://github.com/BluFedora/ZombieBoyLevelEditor","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"This is a level editor I made for my freshman year student game project during the 2017-2018 school year.
