That is:  A set of raw images, from the camera, lives in a directory. The program should take, as arguments, the names of a set of raw images. E.g., if photos/ is the directory and album is your program, one might invoke the program via the shell command line as album photos/*.jpg. For each photo in this input set, the program should: Generate a thumbnail version (e.g., very small) of the photo (using the Linux command-line convert program) Display the thumbnail to the user (using the Linux command-line display program) Ask the user whether or not it should be rotated; if so, do it. (using the Linux command-line convert program) Ask the user for a caption, and collect it. Generate a properly oriented half-size version of the photo (using the Linux command-line convert program) When done, the program should leave the following in the directory in which it was invoked. (That is, if you were in foo/ when you invoked album, then all these things go into foo/) a file index.html containing, for each photo: a properly oriented thumbnail a caption a link from the thumbnail to a properly oriented medium-size version of the photo the thumbnails and medium-size versions.","score":1844},{"name":"robotal/Final","owner":"robotal","html_url":"https://github.com/robotal/Final","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"score":1843},{"name":"calvintirrell/lightHouseLabsFuzzBizzNezz","owner":"calvintirrell","html_url":"https://github.com/calvintirrell/lightHouseLabsFuzzBizzNezz","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"prep
