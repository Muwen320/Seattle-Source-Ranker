BFloat is the Buoyant Float type, allowing fixed-precision representation at an arbitrary precision range.  The library is based on code from: Lunter G. HMMoC\u2014a compiler for hidden Markov models. Bioinformatics (2007) 23(18): 2485-2487. The code was derived by Ian Holmes and Gerton Lunter from Holmes I, Rubin GM. An expectation maximization algorithm for training hidden substitution models.  J Mol Biol. 2002 Apr 12;317(5):753-64.
