That is:  A set of raw images, from the camera, lives in a directory. The program should take, as arguments, the names of a set of raw images. E.g., if photos/ is the directory and album is your program, one might invoke the program via the shell command line as album photos/*.jpg. For each photo in this input set, the program should: Generate a thumbnail version (e.g., very small) of the photo (using the Linux command-line convert program) Display the thumbnail to the user (using the Linux command-line display program) Ask the user whether or not it should be rotated; if so, do it. (using the Linux command-line convert program) Ask the user for a caption, and collect it. Generate a properly oriented half-size version of the photo (using the Linux command-line convert program) When done, the program should leave the following in the directory in which it was invoked. (That is, if you were in foo/ when you invoked album, then all these things go into foo/) a file index.html containing, for each photo: a properly oriented thumbnail a caption a link from the thumbnail to a properly oriented medium-size version of the photo the thumbnails and medium-size versions.","topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":418729},{"name":"Grantapher/tcss333-hw2","owner":"Grantapher","html_url":"https://github.com/Grantapher/tcss333-hw2","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":418839},{"name":"Grantapher/tcss333-hw1","owner":"Grantapher","html_url":"https://github.com/Grantapher/tcss333-hw1","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":418841},{"name":"trvvss/C","owner":"trvvss","html_url":"https://github.com/trvvss/C","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":418844},{"name":"UWIT-IAM/uw-idp-preauthenticator","owner":"UWIT-IAM","html_url":"https://github.com/UWIT-IAM/uw-idp-preauthenticator","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Intercepts Google logins and assures user has google account before continuing with login","topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":418856},{"name":"AshwinChandlapur/Spoj","owner":"AshwinChandlapur","html_url":"https://github.com/AshwinChandlapur/Spoj","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Solutions to Problems on SPOJ","topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":418908},{"name":"xiddw/nm-morph","owner":"xiddw","html_url":"https://github.com/xiddw/nm-morph","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/nm-morph","topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":418928},{"name":"AJLeuer/Excel-Data-Copy-Tool","owner":"AJLeuer","html_url":"https://github.com/AJLeuer/Excel-Data-Copy-Tool","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Tool for copying data between Excel spreadsheets","topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":418938},{"name":"TDA/C-BYO-Lisp","owner":"TDA","html_url":"https://github.com/TDA/C-BYO-Lisp","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":418967},{"name":"bk5115545/game_engine","owner":"bk5115545","html_url":"https://github.com/bk5115545/game_engine","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Final project for Advanced Game Programming","topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":419016},{"name":"hyejshin/Bonobono","owner":"hyejshin","html_url":"https://github.com/hyejshin/Bonobono","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Bonobono game using OpenGL","topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":419031},{"name":"heftyfunseeker/cs375","owner":"heftyfunseeker","html_url":"https://github.com/heftyfunseeker/cs375","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":419084},{"name":"nbirnel/suckless-formula","owner":"nbirnel","html_url":"https://github.com/nbirnel/suckless-formula","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":419161},{"name":"tabletenniser/ECE568_hw1","owner":"tabletenniser","html_url":"https://github.com/tabletenniser/ECE568_hw1","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":419171},{"name":"RGirish/12th-grade-project","owner":"RGirish","html_url":"https://github.com/RGirish/12th-grade-project","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"This repo contains the source for the Game and Drawing Utility that I created as a Capstone project during the final year of my High School.","topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":419229},{"name":"anas2204/GraphicsGame","owner":"anas2204","html_url":"https://github.com/anas2204/GraphicsGame","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Game written in OpenGL, inspired from \"Qbert\"","topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":419238},{"name":"avagin/trivial_vpn","owner":"avagin","html_url":"https://github.com/avagin/trivial_vpn","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":419262},{"name":"sushanthr/StlParser","owner":"sushanthr","html_url":"https://github.com/sushanthr/StlParser","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Tokenizer to produce vertex buffers from .STL file format","topics":[],"score":1843,"global_rank":419267}]
