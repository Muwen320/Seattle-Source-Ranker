The game includes five different categories: Historical Events, Inventions, Pop Culture, Computer Science History, and Video Games. A \"sixth category\" is the option to play with cards from all five decks at once.  The player has to try to place all of their cards in the correct chronological order on the table, with a randomly drawn card representing the first event. If the player guesses incorrectly, they must discard their current card and draw a new one. In order to win the game, the player must place all of their cards on the table before time runs out!","topics":[],"score":2127,"global_rank":265443},{"name":"adrianba/printable-buffer","owner":"adrianba","html_url":"https://github.com/adrianba/printable-buffer","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Particle library for printable-buffer","topics":[],"score":2127,"global_rank":265628},{"name":"HarshavardhanK/Auto-Correct","owner":"HarshavardhanK","html_url":"https://github.com/HarshavardhanK/Auto-Correct","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Implementations of auto correct feature","topics":["algorithms-and-data-structures","autocorrect","cpp"],"score":2127,"global_rank":265671},{"name":"jongminHan/GeneticAlgorithm","owner":"jongminHan","html_url":"https://github.com/jongminHan/GeneticAlgorithm","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"This is a source code of Genetic Algorithm which solves Knapsack Problem.","topics":[],"score":2127,"global_rank":265696},{"name":"BichengLUO/BVHTreeRayTracer","owner":"BichengLUO","html_url":"https://github.com/BichengLUO/BVHTreeRayTracer","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A ray tracer based on bounding volume hierarchy tree (BVH tree)","topics":[],"score":2127,"global_rank":265732},{"name":"dilraj45/spoj-sol","owner":"dilraj45","html_url":"https://github.com/dilraj45/spoj-sol","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2127,"global_rank":265758},{"name":"nc-uw/Cplusplus","owner":"nc-uw","html_url":"https://github.com/nc-uw/Cplusplus","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2127,"global_rank":265783},{"name":"Sunhick/bazel201-cc","owner":"Sunhick","html_url":"https://github.com/Sunhick/bazel201-cc","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"bazel cross compile","topics":[],"score":2127,"global_rank":265866},{"name":"Sunhick/bazel101-libs","owner":"Sunhick","html_url":"https://github.com/Sunhick/bazel101-libs","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2127,"global_rank":265867},{"name":"jselbie/PuzzleSolver","owner":"jselbie","html_url":"https://github.com/jselbie/PuzzleSolver","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Code that I wrote to solve the Lagoon Internet Puzzle Adventure: Valley of the Kings","topics":[],"score":2127,"global_rank":265875},{"name":"Artyom17/angle-multiview","owner":"Artyom17","html_url":"https://github.com/Artyom17/angle-multiview","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"ANGLE with proper WebGL multiview support","topics":[],"score":2127,"global_rank":265904},{"name":"kalyanghosh/A-Tour-of-Cpp","owner":"kalyanghosh","html_url":"https://github.com/kalyanghosh/A-Tour-of-Cpp","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"This repository contains code implementation of different important topics in C++ including Object Oriented Design concepts using C++","topics":[],"score":2127,"global_rank":265941},{"name":"pfdinc/connect4","owner":"pfdinc","html_url":"https://github.com/pfdinc/connect4","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2127,"global_rank":265983},{"name":"AndroidonEarth/Rewind-Revitalize","owner":"AndroidonEarth","html_url":"https://github.com/AndroidonEarth/Rewind-Revitalize","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A journaling C++ console program to promote mindfulness and mental health.
