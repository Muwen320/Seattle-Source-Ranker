The functionality provided by these programs is similar to the standard ping-program available in modern operating system. Ping works by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) ECHO-messages which the remote machines echo back to the sender, who can then determine the round-trip times between itself and the computer it pinged. In this lab you will implement use standard UDP sockets ad messages to measure the round trip time (RTT) between a client and server.","topics":[],"score":1903},{"name":"elevenlee/cc_syntax_analyzer","owner":"elevenlee","html_url":"https://github.com/elevenlee/cc_syntax_analyzer","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Syntax Analysis: Parser","topics":[],"score":1903},{"name":"drew212/FibHeap","owner":"drew212","html_url":"https://github.com/drew212/FibHeap","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Fibonacci Heap implementation","topics":[],"score":1901},{"name":"kaniini/unreal-git","owner":"kaniini","html_url":"https://github.com/kaniini/unreal-git","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"git mirror of hg.unrealircd.org","topics":[],"score":1900},{"name":"PatriceVignola/astral-tides","owner":"PatriceVignola","html_url":"https://github.com/PatriceVignola/astral-tides","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Game developed for the Ubisoft Game Lab Competition 2016.","topics":[],"score":1900},{"name":"johnmoon311/Traffic-Simmulation","owner":"johnmoon311","html_url":"https://github.com/johnmoon311/Traffic-Simmulation","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"C++ with SFML GUI Library","topics":[],"score":1900},{"name":"johnmoon311/PacmanSolver","owner":"johnmoon311","html_url":"https://github.com/johnmoon311/PacmanSolver","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"C++ with SFML GUI Library","topics":[],"score":1900},{"name":"johnmoon311/Tetris","owner":"johnmoon311","html_url":"https://github.com/johnmoon311/Tetris","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"C++ with SFML GUI Library","topics":[],"score":1900},{"name":"HanmingZhang/TheCube","owner":"HanmingZhang","html_url":"https://github.com/HanmingZhang/TheCube","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Our CIS 568 Game Design Final Team Project.
