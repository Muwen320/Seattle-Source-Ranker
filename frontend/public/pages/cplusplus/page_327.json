The functionality provided by these programs is similar to the standard ping-program available in modern operating system. Ping works by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) ECHO-messages which the remote machines echo back to the sender, who can then determine the round-trip times between itself and the computer it pinged. In this lab you will implement use standard UDP sockets ad messages to measure the round trip time (RTT) between a client and server.","score":1904},{"name":"elevenlee/cc_syntax_analyzer","owner":"elevenlee","html_url":"https://github.com/elevenlee/cc_syntax_analyzer","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Syntax Analysis: Parser","score":1904},{"name":"bayesianbrad/openmalaria_probprog","owner":"bayesianbrad","html_url":"https://github.com/bayesianbrad/openmalaria_probprog","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":11,"language":"C++","description":"PPX protocols for open malaria","score":1903},{"name":"drew212/FibHeap","owner":"drew212","html_url":"https://github.com/drew212/FibHeap","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Fibonacci Heap implementation","score":1902},{"name":"dhutchis/ppp","owner":"dhutchis","html_url":"https://github.com/dhutchis/ppp","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Power Proxy Project!","score":1901},{"name":"kaniini/unreal-git","owner":"kaniini","html_url":"https://github.com/kaniini/unreal-git","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"git mirror of hg.unrealircd.org","score":1901},{"name":"mlfong/minesweeper-gtk","owner":"mlfong","html_url":"https://github.com/mlfong/minesweeper-gtk","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"cs-2804 final project: minesweeper game","score":1900},{"name":"avshabanov/ctemplates","owner":"avshabanov","html_url":"https://github.com/avshabanov/ctemplates","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"C templates-alike library for common data structures","score":1900},{"name":"SaintAnger589/cppPractice","owner":"SaintAnger589","html_url":"https://github.com/SaintAnger589/cppPractice","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Cpp Practice","score":1899},{"name":"laperlej/geec_tools","owner":"laperlej","html_url":"https://github.com/laperlej/geec_tools","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Cli tool for efficient correlation of epigenomic files","score":1899},{"name":"ignaciohermosillacornejo/competitive_programming","owner":"ignaciohermosillacornejo","html_url":"https://github.com/ignaciohermosillacornejo/competitive_programming","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Personal repo for my competitive programing exercises","score":1899},{"name":"nategraf/otpw","owner":"nategraf","html_url":"https://github.com/nategraf/otpw","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"One time password for Linux authentication - forked from https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/otpw.html","score":1899},{"name":"daerduoCarey/BigHomework","owner":"daerduoCarey","html_url":"https://github.com/daerduoCarey/BigHomework","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Fall 2012","score":1899},{"name":"razerater/data-structures","owner":"razerater","html_url":"https://github.com/razerater/data-structures","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Some C++ programs I wrote for Data Structures (CSCI 1200) at RPI.
