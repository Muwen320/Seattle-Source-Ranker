You will know many basic data structures, algorithms, and the tradeoffs among memory, running time, and implementation time associated with them. Topics include: data abstraction, mathematical induction, propositions quantifiers, proofs, recursion, computational complexity and algorithm analysis, linked lists, stacks, queues, searching and sorting, and object-oriented methods.","topics":[],"score":2508,"global_rank":66829},{"name":"rhettg/stubborn","owner":"rhettg","html_url":"https://github.com/rhettg/stubborn","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A rover","topics":[],"score":2508,"global_rank":66860},{"name":"kennycason/image-shuffle-playdate","owner":"kennycason","html_url":"https://github.com/kennycason/image-shuffle-playdate","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Image Shuffle Puzzle Game using C API","topics":[],"score":2508,"global_rank":66868},{"name":"vanjac/voxel-raymarching","owner":"vanjac","html_url":"https://github.com/vanjac/voxel-raymarching","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Small experiment with a voxel raymarching shader, built with Qt","topics":[],"score":2508,"global_rank":66882},{"name":"mgcarbonell/scrabble-in-c","owner":"mgcarbonell","html_url":"https://github.com/mgcarbonell/scrabble-in-c","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Simple C scrabble like function from CS50","topics":[],"score":2508,"global_rank":66917},{"name":"MT-jlem/push_swap","owner":"MT-jlem","html_url":"https://github.com/MT-jlem/push_swap","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.
