Forensic Artifact Extractor (VFAE) is windows based tool written in C++ that extracts files with a known location from VMDK images running the Windows operating system.  The tool utilizes the VDDK (Virtual Disk Development Kit) API for the  heavy lifting such as mounting, opening, and reading the VMDK selected.  When vfae.exe is executed, it copies out files from an off-line VMDK file.  The application allows the user to conduct a quick triage of the Windows  directory structure by outputing the results to a specific output file (vfae_output_<localtime>.txt.  Additionally,  it conducts a MD5 hash value of the VMDK itself if needed.  For specific file searching  purposes, it searches for any filetype within the off-line VMDK based on a passed in argument via the command-line. Furthermore, you can extract those file that were found in a hard-coded \"Extracted Files\" directory as well as provide the MD5 hash of each file that was extracted.","topics":[],"score":3423,"global_rank":14533},{"name":"stammen/SystemControl","owner":"stammen","html_url":"https://github.com/stammen/SystemControl","stars":8,"forks":4,"issues":1,"language":"C++","description":"Win32 System Control from a UWP App Sample","topics":[],"score":3422,"global_rank":14559},{"name":"xjli/r2r_vln","owner":"xjli","html_url":"https://github.com/xjli/r2r_vln","stars":7,"forks":2,"issues":3,"language":"C++","description":"Room-to-Room (R2R) vision-and-language navigation","topics":[],"score":3422,"global_rank":14560},{"name":"Eastonco/CS360","owner":"Eastonco","html_url":"https://github.com/Eastonco/CS360","stars":16,"forks":9,"issues":4,"language":"C","description":"All projects and assignments for Cpt_S 360, taken fall 2020 at WSU","topics":["360","cpts360","wsu"],"score":3421,"global_rank":14573},{"name":"kmaragon/cxxmetrics","owner":"kmaragon","html_url":"https://github.com/kmaragon/cxxmetrics","stars":4,"forks":3,"issues":1,"language":"C++","description":"A C++14 only metrics library inspired by codahale/dropwizard metrics but with tagging (still in progress - look for the README.md when it's done)","topics":[],"score":3421,"global_rank":14584},{"name":"PazerOP/CastingEssentials","owner":"PazerOP","html_url":"https://github.com/PazerOP/CastingEssentials","stars":31,"forks":13,"issues":38,"language":"C++","description":"A Team Fortress 2 client plugin that enhances the experience of both casters and viewers.","topics":[],"score":3420,"global_rank":14588},{"name":"srenevey/satops","owner":"srenevey","html_url":"https://github.com/srenevey/satops","stars":10,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A simulation environment to predict spacecraft attitude and trajectories","topics":["astrodynamics","attitude-dynamics","orbital-mechanics","orbital-simulation","satellite","spacecraft"],"score":3417,"global_rank":14645},{"name":"CodeMaxx/nv-heap","owner":"CodeMaxx","html_url":"https://github.com/CodeMaxx/nv-heap","stars":8,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Implementation of the simplified version of the NV-Heap paper (https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece598ms/sp2018/papers/paper44.pdf)","topics":["akash-trehan","cloud-computing","codemaxx","course-project","iitb","iitbombay","non-volatile-memory","non-volatile-storage","nv-heap","nvm","nvram","persistent-data-structure","persistent-memory","persistent-storage","pmdk","pmem","virtualization"],"score":3417,"global_rank":14648},{"name":"Reedbeta/reed-framework","owner":"Reedbeta","html_url":"https://github.com/Reedbeta/reed-framework","stars":34,"forks":4,"issues":5,"language":"C","description":"Basic framework for D3D11 init, model/texture loading, shader compilation and camera movement.","topics":[],"score":3416,"global_rank":14657},{"name":"skalldri/StandingDeskControl","owner":"skalldri","html_url":"https://github.com/skalldri/StandingDeskControl","stars":20,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A UWP App which will run on a RaspBerry Pi to control the height of an Ikea Bekant Standing Desk","topics":[],"score":3414,"global_rank":14697}]
