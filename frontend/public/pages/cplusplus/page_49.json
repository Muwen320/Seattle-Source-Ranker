You will know many basic data structures, algorithms, and the tradeoffs among memory, running time, and implementation time associated with them. Topics include: data abstraction, mathematical induction, propositions quantifiers, proofs, recursion, computational complexity and algorithm analysis, linked lists, stacks, queues, searching and sorting, and object-oriented methods.","topics":[],"score":2508,"global_rank":61674},{"name":"thomhastings/mimikatz","owner":"thomhastings","html_url":"https://github.com/thomhastings/mimikatz","stars":6,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Benjamin \"gentilkiwi\" Delpy's mimikatz via git-svn","topics":[],"score":2507,"global_rank":61828},{"name":"badrobit/RGBD-Inpainting","owner":"badrobit","html_url":"https://github.com/badrobit/RGBD-Inpainting","stars":4,"forks":0,"watchers":3,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2507,"global_rank":61831},{"name":"dbadb/dbStompbox","owner":"dbadb","html_url":"https://github.com/dbadb/dbStompbox","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Simple TeensyLC-based MIDI controller.","topics":[],"score":2507,"global_rank":61888},{"name":"rhettg/stubborn","owner":"rhettg","html_url":"https://github.com/rhettg/stubborn","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A rover","topics":[],"score":2507,"global_rank":61892},{"name":"jtbandes/get_cuts","owner":"jtbandes","html_url":"https://github.com/jtbandes/get_cuts","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":2,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Data processing and histogram calculation for particle jets","topics":["cpp","physics"],"score":2507,"global_rank":61950},{"name":"MasonYDL/leetcode_mason","owner":"MasonYDL","html_url":"https://github.com/MasonYDL/leetcode_mason","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"personal leetcode practice ","topics":[],"score":2507,"global_rank":61998},{"name":"Rock2003/ArduinoCalculator","owner":"Rock2003","html_url":"https://github.com/Rock2003/ArduinoCalculator","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2507,"global_rank":62011},{"name":"abhishek-v/Cognitive-radio-allocation","owner":"abhishek-v","html_url":"https://github.com/abhishek-v/Cognitive-radio-allocation","stars":2,"forks":1,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Allocation of secondary users in cognitive radio system by the use of a genetic algorithm.","topics":[],"score":2506,"global_rank":62128},{"name":"shmuelie/ziopp","owner":"shmuelie","html_url":"https://github.com/shmuelie/ziopp","stars":2,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Zio++ provides a simple, powerful, cross-platform filesystem abstraction for C++ with many built-ins filesystems.","topics":["c-plus-plus","cpp","filesystem","filesystem-api","vfs"],"score":2506,"global_rank":62135},{"name":"RodDeacon/CS132-mini05-STL1","owner":"RodDeacon","html_url":"https://github.com/RodDeacon/CS132-mini05-STL1","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2506,"global_rank":62162},{"name":"amarburg/trivial_oculus_gui","owner":"amarburg","html_url":"https://github.com/amarburg/trivial_oculus_gui","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2506,"global_rank":62163},{"name":"Andydandy77/SchedulerSimulator","owner":"Andydandy77","html_url":"https://github.com/Andydandy77/SchedulerSimulator","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2506,"global_rank":62171},{"name":"swgillespie/apollo3","owner":"swgillespie","html_url":"https://github.com/swgillespie/apollo3","stars":1,"forks":1,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Apollo chess engine, V3","topics":[],"score":2506,"global_rank":62231},{"name":"zhourunlong/ComputerGraphics","owner":"zhourunlong","html_url":"https://github.com/zhourunlong/ComputerGraphics","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Advanced Computer Graphics (IIIS)","topics":[],"score":2506,"global_rank":62246},{"name":"IanHollow/VexV5Robotics-98333B","owner":"IanHollow","html_url":"https://github.com/IanHollow/VexV5Robotics-98333B","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"2021 to 2022 Vex V5 Robotics Code","topics":[],"score":2506,"global_rank":62257},{"name":"RazConsta/Gaming-Store","owner":"RazConsta","html_url":"https://github.com/RazConsta/Gaming-Store","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"My first dive into the world of programming - a terminal-based computer parts store with product search, shopping cart, and order shipping functionality.
