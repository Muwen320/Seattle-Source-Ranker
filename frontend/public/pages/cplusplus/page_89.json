The player's goal is to guide an adventurer to kill the Wumpus, find its hidden gold, and escape alive. The Wumpus lives in a large cave of rooms arranged in a grid, where each room has four tunnels leading to the rooms to the north, east, south, and west.  The adventurer starts the game in a random empty room in the Wumpus\u2019 cave. Her starting position is also the location of the escape rope that she must use to escape after she's completed her task.  Each room may be empty, or it may contain one (and only one) of four \"events\" (all described below): two kinds of dangerous hazards, the terrifying Wumpus, and the gold treasure. When the adventurer is in a room that\u2019s adjacent to one containing an \"event\", the player will receive a percept (a message) to inform them about the event the adventurer is close to.  If the adventurer perishes while searching for the Wumpus, the player should be presented with the option to start the game over with the same cave configuration, start the game over with a new random cave configuration, or quit the game entirely.  The player wins the game if they can safely guide the adventurer through the cave to kill the Wumpus, pick up the gold, and make it back to the escape rope unharmed! Note: If you enter the cave, retrieve the gold, and escape without killing the Wumpus, that's okay too. The player still wins.","topics":[],"score":2486},{"name":"darshit-desai/ROS2-Turtlebot-control-using-Fiducial-markers","owner":"darshit-desai","html_url":"https://github.com/darshit-desai/ROS2-Turtlebot-control-using-Fiducial-markers","stars":0,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A final project for the Robotics Programming course where we used ROS2 Galactic to control turtlebot's motion and guide it to it's target location given by fiducial markers","topics":["aruco-markers","cpp","fiducial-markers","galactic","oops-in-cpp","ros","ros2","turtlebot3"],"score":2486},{"name":"berfarah/zmk-config","owner":"berfarah","html_url":"https://github.com/berfarah/zmk-config","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2486},{"name":"lindsayrgwatt/self-water-planter","owner":"lindsayrgwatt","html_url":"https://github.com/lindsayrgwatt/self-water-planter","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A simple self-watering plant system using a Seeed Wio Terminal","topics":["arduino","self-watering-plant","wio-terminal"],"score":2486},{"name":"episcopus/6809_core","owner":"episcopus","html_url":"https://github.com/episcopus/6809_core","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":8,"language":"C","description":"Emulator core for MC6809E processor","topics":[],"score":2485},{"name":"doggeral/6.828","owner":"doggeral","html_url":"https://github.com/doggeral/6.828","stars":3,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Lab for 6.828","topics":[],"score":2485},{"name":"warmoverdrive/advent-of-code-21","owner":"warmoverdrive","html_url":"https://github.com/warmoverdrive/advent-of-code-21","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"2021 Advent of Code - Learning C++ Through Problem-solving!
