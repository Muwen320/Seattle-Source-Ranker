The proxy server is used to reduce the bandwidth, latency and the server load. The cache web proxy server caches the client\u2019s requests to the server. Each client request goes through the proxy server. The cache web proxy server responds to the client with the requested information if the files exist. If the cache web proxy doesn\u2019t host the requested information, it talks to the server and fetches the requested information. The subsequent requests to that file will be handled by the cache web proxy server instead of the main server hosting the files. The cache web proxy server fetches the files from the main server until its buffer runs out. The server then deletes the files to make space for the new files.","score":1854},{"name":"ropwareJB/dwm","owner":"ropwareJB","html_url":"https://github.com/ropwareJB/dwm","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Personal fork of DWM http://git.suckless.org/dwm/","score":1854},{"name":"tj-byun/obd2","owner":"tj-byun","html_url":"https://github.com/tj-byun/obd2","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"score":1854},{"name":"pfdinc/Nasm-cpp-itr","owner":"pfdinc","html_url":"https://github.com/pfdinc/Nasm-cpp-itr","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"iterating through an array recursively","score":1854},{"name":"pfdinc/NASM-C-Prompt","owner":"pfdinc","html_url":"https://github.com/pfdinc/NASM-C-Prompt","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Visual Studio File - Nasm - C++ - Prompt","score":1854},{"name":"mattsains/SunriseAlarmClock","owner":"mattsains","html_url":"https://github.com/mattsains/SunriseAlarmClock","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"An alarm clock which slowly increases ambient light to wake you up","score":1854},{"name":"aria42/lstm-play","owner":"aria42","html_url":"https://github.com/aria42/lstm-play","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A hello world for playing with bilstms","score":1854},{"name":"somdeep/DBSI-Btree-1","owner":"somdeep","html_url":"https://github.com/somdeep/DBSI-Btree-1","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"score":1854},{"name":"somdeep/dbsip2","owner":"somdeep","html_url":"https://github.com/somdeep/dbsip2","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"DBSI Project 2 Part 2","score":1854},{"name":"gmittert/piPlay","owner":"gmittert","html_url":"https://github.com/gmittert/piPlay","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"score":1854},{"name":"robertsatya/eudyptula","owner":"robertsatya","html_url":"https://github.com/robertsatya/eudyptula","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"An attempt at solving the tasks in Eudyptula Challenge and get acquainted with kernal module coding.","score":1854},{"name":"robertsatya/depth-fusion","owner":"robertsatya","html_url":"https://github.com/robertsatya/depth-fusion","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"score":1854},{"name":"robertsatya/ros-bot","owner":"robertsatya","html_url":"https://github.com/robertsatya/ros-bot","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A collection of 2 major and several mini-projects based on ROS (Robotic Operating System)","score":1854},{"name":"bwelton/cmpiprof","owner":"bwelton","html_url":"https://github.com/bwelton/cmpiprof","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"MPI aware cuda profiler","score":1854},{"name":"kayeon/c-tutorial","owner":"kayeon","html_url":"https://github.com/kayeon/c-tutorial","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"score":1854},{"name":"dandean/pebble-watchface","owner":"dandean","html_url":"https://github.com/dandean/pebble-watchface","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"Learning how to make a pebble watchface","score":1854},{"name":"kamanashisroy/designsnippet","owner":"kamanashisroy","html_url":"https://github.com/kamanashisroy/designsnippet","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"score":1854},{"name":"gnayuy/cylindermap","owner":"gnayuy","html_url":"https://github.com/gnayuy/cylindermap","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"cylindrical mapping with glsl","score":1854},{"name":"ahungrynacho/Mua-Xuan-2016---Lop-May-Vi-Tinh-53-Bai-2","owner":"ahungrynacho","html_url":"https://github.com/ahungrynacho/Mua-Xuan-2016---Lop-May-Vi-Tinh-53-Bai-2","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"score":1853},{"name":"bryanchacosky/crafter.cpp","owner":"bryanchacosky","html_url":"https://github.com/bryanchacosky/crafter.cpp","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Minocraft-esque crafting code sample.","score":1853},{"name":"CardinalWolsey/the_c_programming_language","owner":"CardinalWolsey","html_url":"https://github.com/CardinalWolsey/the_c_programming_language","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"score":1853},{"name":"monimoyb/Nbody_Sim","owner":"monimoyb","html_url":"https://github.com/monimoyb/Nbody_Sim","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"An N-body gravitational simulation to simulate the movement of planets, stars etc. over an expansive space.
