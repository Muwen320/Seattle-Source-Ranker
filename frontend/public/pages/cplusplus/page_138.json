It comes from years of experience working with ASP, but is not quite complete. As of release 4, the library also includes a number of server-side and client-side javascript libraries. Due to numerous limitations in the compilers that come with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.x, this code only works with the updated compilers from MSVC++ 7.0 (.NET). These can be downloaded for free from Microsoft. It also requires the ATL library that comes with MSVC 7. This project is mostly useless these days, as few people code ASP with COM and ActiveX anymore.","topics":["activex","asp","com"],"score":2214,"global_rank":220845},{"name":"telemething/MFuse","owner":"telemething","html_url":"https://github.com/telemething/MFuse","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Mulispectral Multimodal On-Line Image Fusion","topics":[],"score":2214,"global_rank":220941},{"name":"MaxHirata/twilio-narrowband","owner":"MaxHirata","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxHirata/twilio-narrowband","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"testing out modules on narrowband board ","topics":[],"score":2214,"global_rank":221017},{"name":"JamesPRobertson/LinkedChar","owner":"JamesPRobertson","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesPRobertson/LinkedChar","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2214,"global_rank":221092},{"name":"sarahgrace/cppcon2019","owner":"sarahgrace","html_url":"https://github.com/sarahgrace/cppcon2019","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2214,"global_rank":221144},{"name":"jhgrins/Raytracer","owner":"jhgrins","html_url":"https://github.com/jhgrins/Raytracer","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Raytracing engine used to create gifs","topics":["cpp","graphics","raytracer"],"score":2214,"global_rank":221229},{"name":"artvvb/TerrainGenerator","owner":"artvvb","html_url":"https://github.com/artvvb/TerrainGenerator","stars":2,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"height-map based 2-D world generator","topics":[],"score":2213,"global_rank":221258},{"name":"kmojabe/ZorkCPP","owner":"kmojabe","html_url":"https://github.com/kmojabe/ZorkCPP","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"ECE 30862 project","topics":[],"score":2213,"global_rank":221280},{"name":"iShoe/characterRecognition","owner":"iShoe","html_url":"https://github.com/iShoe/characterRecognition","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Implemeted using k-nearest neighbour's algorithms to train model to recognize alphabets and numbers using C++ and OpenCV.","topics":[],"score":2213,"global_rank":221283},{"name":"yesoun/Multi_Layer_Perceptron_IrisData_C-_CUDA","owner":"yesoun","html_url":"https://github.com/yesoun/Multi_Layer_Perceptron_IrisData_C-_CUDA","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2213,"global_rank":221314},{"name":"varun196/xml_parser","owner":"varun196","html_url":"https://github.com/varun196/xml_parser","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2213,"global_rank":221321},{"name":"scottwat86/learn-c.org","owner":"scottwat86","html_url":"https://github.com/scottwat86/learn-c.org","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2213,"global_rank":221411},{"name":"chrismoroney/Bellevue-College-CS-212","owner":"chrismoroney","html_url":"https://github.com/chrismoroney/Bellevue-College-CS-212","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Bellevue College CS 212 (C++ Data Structures) written in C++ ","topics":[],"score":2213,"global_rank":221431},{"name":"carlaMorral/MovieFinder","owner":"carlaMorral","html_url":"https://github.com/carlaMorral/MovieFinder","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"The aim of this project is to show some of the most common operations of a tree together with the implementations of both an AVL and BST trees.","topics":[],"score":2213,"global_rank":221447},{"name":"juloaiza/CppND-Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation","owner":"juloaiza","html_url":"https://github.com/juloaiza/CppND-Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"This is the project for the fourth course in the Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program: Concurrency.","topics":[],"score":2213,"global_rank":221475},{"name":"eric-cw-hsu/Return0","owner":"eric-cw-hsu","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-cw-hsu/Return0","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":4,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2213,"global_rank":221487},{"name":"jblebrun/arduboy-treasure","owner":"jblebrun","html_url":"https://github.com/jblebrun/arduboy-treasure","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Arduboy Treasure -
