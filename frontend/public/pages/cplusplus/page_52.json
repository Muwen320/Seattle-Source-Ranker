It is also expected that a compiler should make the target code efficient and optimized in terms of time and space.  Compiler design principles provide an in-depth view of translation and optimization process. Compiler design covers basic translation mechanism and error detection & recovery. It includes lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis as front end, and code generation and optimization as back-end.","topics":[],"score":2719},{"name":"t0rr3sp3dr0/rengiSPAS","owner":"t0rr3sp3dr0","html_url":"https://github.com/t0rr3sp3dr0/rengiSPAS","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2718},{"name":"WitchFreya/EvolvedRoleProgression","owner":"WitchFreya","html_url":"https://github.com/WitchFreya/EvolvedRoleProgression","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":2,"language":"C++","description":"Role Progression system for Arma 3","topics":[],"score":2718},{"name":"jrpat/sex","owner":"jrpat","html_url":"https://github.com/jrpat/sex","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"A simple s-expression parser","topics":[],"score":2718},{"name":"diamondburned/factl","owner":"diamondburned","html_url":"https://github.com/diamondburned/factl","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"CSU Fullerton Algorithm Competition Template Library","topics":[],"score":2718},{"name":"theabolton/ghostess","owner":"theabolton","html_url":"https://github.com/theabolton/ghostess","stars":5,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"A lightweight GTK+ host for DSSI plugins","topics":[],"score":2717},{"name":"mihirthatte/http_server","owner":"mihirthatte","html_url":"https://github.com/mihirthatte/http_server","stars":2,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":null,"topics":["computer-networks","http-server","socket-programming","tcp-client","tcp-server","udp-client","udp-server"],"score":2717},{"name":"artkolpakov/archiver","owner":"artkolpakov","html_url":"https://github.com/artkolpakov/archiver","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"A program that serves as an archiver or unarchiver of text files/directories.","topics":[],"score":2717},{"name":"xuhdev/tags2db","owner":"xuhdev","html_url":"https://github.com/xuhdev/tags2db","stars":13,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"C","description":"Convert tag files (ctags, gccxml, etc) to databases (sqlite, mysql, etc)","topics":[],"score":2716},{"name":"dag10/sfml-platformer","owner":"dag10","html_url":"https://github.com/dag10/sfml-platformer","stars":7,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"A functional but incomplete SFML-based multiplayer platformer game/engine.","topics":[],"score":2716},{"name":"zijistark/libck2","owner":"zijistark","html_url":"https://github.com/zijistark/libck2","stars":3,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"An efficient and powerful C++ library for accessing Crusader Kings II game files & saved games (automation, validation, data extraction, etc.).","topics":[],"score":2716},{"name":"jrpat/zest","owner":"jrpat","html_url":"https://github.com/jrpat/zest","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"C++","description":"A zepto-scale testing library for C++20","topics":[],"score":2716},{"name":"ShamylZakariya/MarchingCubes","owner":"ShamylZakariya","html_url":"https://github.com/ShamylZakariya/MarchingCubes","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C++","description":"Just a simple marching cubes experiment","topics":[],"score":2716},{"name":"lcn2/pr","owner":"lcn2","html_url":"https://github.com/lcn2/pr","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"libpr - stdio helper library","topics":[],"score":2716},{"name":"taradinoc/zlr","owner":"taradinoc","html_url":"https://github.com/taradinoc/zlr","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"C","description":"A mirror of the main ZLR repository (https://foss.heptapod.net/zilf/zlr).
