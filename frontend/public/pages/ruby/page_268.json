Using these helper methods the MANY side model will be cognizant of the ONE model but the ONE side model will not be directly cognizant of the MANY model. Both will be cognizant of the JOIN model, however. This is a rare scenario. Let\u2019s use a bizarre, somewhat contrived, and controversial example. Let\u2019s say we have a ONE side model, God. The MANY side model would be Human. Each God could have MANY Humans following him/her through a JOIN model of GuardianAngel.
