Using a through object is helpful when you want to store information specific to the association of two items\u2014instead of just wanting to store the association itself. Using these helper methods the MANY side model will be cognizant of the ONE model but the ONE side model will not be directly cognizant of the MANY model. Both will be cognizant of the JOIN model, however. This is a rare scenario. Let\u2019s use a bizarre, somewhat contrived, and controversial example. Let\u2019s say we have a ONE side model, God. The MANY side model would be Human. Each God could have MANY Humans following him/her through a JOIN model of GuardianAngel. The God model could have many GuardianAngels but lets say s/he doesn\u2019t care about keeping track of all his/her follower Humans.
