Results of this project is converted into a .csv format which is provided in the zip folder with the code and then it is compared with Kaggle results so the accuracy what we get over here might slightly vary from the accuracy we achieve in Kaggle submission. Totally 3 diverse types of neural network operations are tried on this dataset i.e. 1) Single Hidden MLP 2) RNN 3) DNN each Neural Net is processed in different ipynb files before combining it. DNN is my baseline model because I achieved my maximum accuracy of 88.53% while processing data with it and rank achieved in it is 1335 out of
