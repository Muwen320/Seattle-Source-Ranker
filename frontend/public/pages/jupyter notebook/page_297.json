At the same time writing efficient computer programs to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult.

Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic, computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.","topics":["parallel-computing"],"score":2131,"global_rank":262748}]
