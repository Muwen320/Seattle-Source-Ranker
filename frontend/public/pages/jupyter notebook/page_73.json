The law standardizes this process by requiring building owners to enter their annual energy and water use in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) online tool, ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager\u00ae and use the tool to submit data to the City. This data informs building owners about a building's energy and water consumption compared to similar buildings, and tracks progress year over year to help in energy efficiency planning.  Benchmarking data is also disclosed publicly, analyzed in reports, visualized in the NYC Energy and Water Performance Map, included in energy efficiency policy development efforts such as the Buildings Technical Working Group Final Report, and used to develop free resources such as the NYC Retrofit Accelerator and Community Retrofit NYC to help building owners use less energy and save money.  Local Law 33 of 2018 amended the Administrative Code of the City of New York in relation to energy efficiency scores and grades for buildings required to benchmark their energy and water consumption. Energy efficiency scores and grades for these buildings shall be obtained, assigned and disclosed in accordance with the new section \u00a728-309.12 annually, based on benchmarking reporting consistent with Federal energy efficiency standards.  An energy efficiency score is the Energy Star Rating that a building earns using the United States Environmental Protection Agency online benchmarking tool, Energy Star Portfolio Manager, to compare building energy performance to similar buildings in similar climates.","topics":[],"score":2517,"global_rank":59425},{"name":"glmack/patent_predict_nlp","owner":"glmack","html_url":"https://github.com/glmack/patent_predict_nlp","stars":1,"forks":1,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Neural NLP classification modelling using patent texts","topics":[],"score":2517,"global_rank":59427},{"name":"lsetiawan/OOI-Workshop","owner":"lsetiawan","html_url":"https://github.com/lsetiawan/OOI-Workshop","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Repository for OOI Workshop","topics":[],"score":2517,"global_rank":59436},{"name":"daniellezhang/seattle_transit_map","owner":"daniellezhang","html_url":"https://github.com/daniellezhang/seattle_transit_map","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2517,"global_rank":59438},{"name":"xliucs/EDRAM-PyTorch","owner":"xliucs","html_url":"https://github.com/xliucs/EDRAM-PyTorch","stars":1,"forks":1,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2517,"global_rank":59440},{"name":"pragyy/DubsTech-Datathon-2023","owner":"pragyy","html_url":"https://github.com/pragyy/DubsTech-Datathon-2023","stars":0,"forks":1,"watchers":2,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2517,"global_rank":59466},{"name":"dmarx/pytti-settings-test","owner":"dmarx","html_url":"https://github.com/dmarx/pytti-settings-test","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2516,"global_rank":59543},{"name":"acheamponge/Game-of-Thrones-Analysis","owner":"acheamponge","html_url":"https://github.com/acheamponge/Game-of-Thrones-Analysis","stars":1,"forks":1,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2516,"global_rank":59544},{"name":"EvidenceN/DataSets","owner":"EvidenceN","html_url":"https://github.com/EvidenceN/DataSets","stars":0,"forks":3,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2516,"global_rank":59591},{"name":"coleloui/python-udemy","owner":"coleloui","html_url":"https://github.com/coleloui/python-udemy","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2516,"global_rank":59605},{"name":"chandrunarayan/intro-to-python","owner":"chandrunarayan","html_url":"https://github.com/chandrunarayan/intro-to-python","stars":0,"forks":1,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2516,"global_rank":59616},{"name":"NathanielBlairStahn/consumer-loan-investment-strategy-simulator","owner":"NathanielBlairStahn","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanielBlairStahn/consumer-loan-investment-strategy-simulator","stars":0,"forks":4,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Performing survival analysis on consumer loans issued through Lending Club to assist in automated investing.","topics":[],"score":2516,"global_rank":59619},{"name":"rjleveque/ptha_rog","owner":"rjleveque","html_url":"https://github.com/rjleveque/ptha_rog","stars":4,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Draft notebooks for review paper on PTHA","topics":[],"score":2515,"global_rank":59644},{"name":"kushalj001/Email-Summarizer-Analyzer","owner":"kushalj001","html_url":"https://github.com/kushalj001/Email-Summarizer-Analyzer","stars":1,"forks":1,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"An implementation of extractive text summarization using bert-as-service for deep embeddings.","topics":["bert-as-service","cucco","deep-learning","nlp","text-summarization"],"score":2515,"global_rank":59692},{"name":"hageslel/bitcoin_lstm_predictions","owner":"hageslel","html_url":"https://github.com/hageslel/bitcoin_lstm_predictions","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"LSTM RNN models utilized to predict future Bitcoin prices.
