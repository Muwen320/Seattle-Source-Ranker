When about 300 hours of video content are uploaded every minute on YouTube, it\u2019s not surprising if a video gets lost in the limbo. With an ever-increasing number of YouTube uploaders, it\u2019s of paramount importance for one to be ahead of the game and incorporate smart strategies to make one\u2019s video(s) relevant. That\u2019s where tagging comes into the picture. Tags are one of the most important ways for an uploader to maximize viewership. A set of relevant tags can help the YouTube search engine optimization to cherry pick such videos and place them much higher on the search results.","score":3033},{"name":"manmeet3/Brain-Tumor-Anomaly-Detection-and-Segmentation","owner":"manmeet3","html_url":"https://github.com/manmeet3/Brain-Tumor-Anomaly-Detection-and-Segmentation","stars":3,"forks":3,"issues":27,"language":"Jupyter
