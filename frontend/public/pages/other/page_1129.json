Gemstone lenses can be rotated to dial in voltage and resistance for extremely high currents without buring out. Gemstone lenses have very little interference or friction for electron travel and do not get hot. Components in electronics do not burn out because of Current. Components burn out because resistance in their circuits generates fricton in electrons and their pathways.  Volts=Current(amps)*Resistance(Ohms)  Watts/Volts=Current(Amps)  Flux is the ability for a capacitor to pass electrons without the electron coming into contact with another electron or surface friction from the component. Flux is the ability to distort the path of an electron so that it arrives at the other end at a controlled rate. Current resistors create a bottleneck to slow down electron flow. Bottlenecks create pressure, friction, and heat. Gemstone capacitors bend the path of an electron with a lense so that the electrons must follow a longer path to reach their destination. This elongated path also acts as a buffer to contain electrons on this elongated path. This type of resistor acts as a capacitor.  Time crystals:  If a crystal elongates the path of an electron. Time is literally dialated for an electron within this path. An electron could travel for 1 hour in a crystal and from the outside of the crystal we would see it only 1 second after pressing a switch.","topics":[],"score":2145.6,"global_rank":254409},{"name":"thomasmchen/uist-2021","owner":"thomasmchen","html_url":"https://github.com/thomasmchen/uist-2021","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":3,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2145.6,"global_rank":254410},{"name":"pce-uw-jscript400/w1-node-ecosystem","owner":"pce-uw-jscript400","html_url":"https://github.com/pce-uw-jscript400/w1-node-ecosystem","stars":0,"forks":32,"watchers":0,"issues":30,"language":"Other","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2145.6,"global_rank":254411},{"name":"trriplejay/jfrog-pipelines-samples","owner":"trriplejay","html_url":"https://github.com/trriplejay/jfrog-pipelines-samples","stars":0,"forks":6,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"Samples
