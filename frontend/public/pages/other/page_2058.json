Second, they should be able to forecast a reasonably effective retirement plan based on their current holdings of cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds. The chief technology officer (CTO) of the credit union wants you to develop a prototype application to present at its next assembly.","topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238125},{"name":"Iruretagoyena/T01_InteligenciaArtificial","owner":"Iruretagoyena","html_url":"https://github.com/Iruretagoyena/T01_InteligenciaArtificial","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238127},{"name":"pcgeek86/make-big-files","owner":"pcgeek86","html_url":"https://github.com/pcgeek86/make-big-files","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"PowerShell","description":"A test repository to generate massive files and test the storage limits of GitHub","topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238130},{"name":"samuelsholib/codeRefactor","owner":"samuelsholib","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelsholib/codeRefactor","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238132},{"name":"samuelsholib/sds-portfolio","owner":"samuelsholib","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelsholib/sds-portfolio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238133},{"name":"dionleung14/Fitness-Tracker","owner":"dionleung14","html_url":"https://github.com/dionleung14/Fitness-Tracker","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238142},{"name":"jfang96/odin-landing-page","owner":"jfang96","html_url":"https://github.com/jfang96/odin-landing-page","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":"Learning to use HTML and CSS to make a landing page","topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238143},{"name":"jfang96/odin-recipes","owner":"jfang96","html_url":"https://github.com/jfang96/odin-recipes","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238144},{"name":"MasonChance/smaccy-design","owner":"MasonChance","html_url":"https://github.com/MasonChance/smaccy-design","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238147},{"name":"AAspCodes/RPS_bash","owner":"AAspCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/AAspCodes/RPS_bash","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238148},{"name":"NateBennett9/ValheimMods","owner":"NateBennett9","html_url":"https://github.com/NateBennett9/ValheimMods","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238149},{"name":"ljg2gb/test","owner":"ljg2gb","html_url":"https://github.com/ljg2gb/test","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238154},{"name":"psturmfels/tilt_measurement","owner":"psturmfels","html_url":"https://github.com/psturmfels/tilt_measurement","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"The second assignment for the mobile health and wireless systems class, implemented in Swift and Xcode.","topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238155},{"name":"giles7777/giles7777.github.io","owner":"giles7777","html_url":"https://github.com/giles7777/giles7777.github.io","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Personal prototypes","topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238159},{"name":"zakhayek/Udacity-Landing-Page","owner":"zakhayek","html_url":"https://github.com/zakhayek/Udacity-Landing-Page","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Landing page created as the second project for a Udacity Course.","topics":[],"score":2171,"global_rank":238161},{"name":"over-taylor-turf/godaddyrepo","owner":"over-taylor-turf","html_url":"https://github.com/over-taylor-turf/godaddyrepo","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"A repo to test the GoDaddy & GH-Pages deployment process.
