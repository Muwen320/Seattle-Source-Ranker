In this approach, once the flow management has been defined, the only way to make an adjustment to the policy is via reconfiguration of the devices. With increasing use of mobile devices, the scaling of networks as per changing traffic demands is restricted by this approach. Software Defined Networks (SDN) is a process where the control is moved out of the individual network nodes and into the separate centralized controller. The controller can hence, exploit complete knowledge of the network to optimize flow management and support user requirements. A custom network topology is created in our project and by using a centralized SDN controller, the network is controlled. After programming the network in tune with our application, packets are generated to test different applications that we developed on the SDN. This project demonstrates the different capabilities of SDN, by implementing 3 major network applications- SDN switch as a hub, SDN switch as a Firewall, and Selective Routing using SDN.","topics":[],"score":2990},{"name":"kdr/avc","owner":"kdr","html_url":"https://github.com/kdr/avc","stars":3,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2990},{"name":"sinharaksh1t/jquery-todo-list","owner":"sinharaksh1t","html_url":"https://github.com/sinharaksh1t/jquery-todo-list","stars":3,"forks":3,"issues":1,"language":"HTML","description":"A To-Do List Web App that is built using jQuery.","topics":[],"score":2990},{"name":"davekilian/davekilian.github.com","owner":"davekilian","html_url":"https://github.com/davekilian/davekilian.github.com","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Personal blog","topics":[],"score":2990},{"name":"joshtynjala/openfl-utest-sample","owner":"joshtynjala","html_url":"https://github.com/joshtynjala/openfl-utest-sample","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Haxe","description":"A sample OpenFL and Haxe project that runs automated tests using UTest","topics":["github-actions","haxe","openfl","openfl-samples","utest"],"score":2990},{"name":"vic-lsh/cs1690-docker","owner":"vic-lsh","html_url":"https://github.com/vic-lsh/cs1690-docker","stars":2,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":"A docker setup for Weenix.","topics":[],"score":2990},{"name":"glstream/sf_app","owner":"glstream","html_url":"https://github.com/glstream/sf_app","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Vue","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2990},{"name":"ETJeanMachine/ETJeanMachine","owner":"ETJeanMachine","html_url":"https://github.com/ETJeanMachine/ETJeanMachine","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Config files for my GitHub profile.","topics":["config","github-config"],"score":2990},{"name":"revbucket/lipMIP","owner":"revbucket","html_url":"https://github.com/revbucket/lipMIP","stars":17,"forks":0,"issues":6,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Mixed integer programming for computing lipschitz constants of ReLU Networks","topics":[],"score":2989},{"name":"PRNicovich/ClusDoC","owner":"PRNicovich","html_url":"https://github.com/PRNicovich/ClusDoC","stars":11,"forks":4,"issues":2,"language":"MATLAB","description":"Repository associated with Clus-DoC clustering and degree of colocalization analysis","topics":[],"score":2989},{"name":"rystsov/faster-paxos-commit","owner":"rystsov","html_url":"https://github.com/rystsov/faster-paxos-commit","stars":10,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"Non-blocking 2PC transactions between key/value storages in 1.5 round trip time","topics":[],"score":2989},{"name":"daewoooo/SaaRclust","owner":"daewoooo","html_url":"https://github.com/daewoooo/SaaRclust","stars":10,"forks":3,"issues":7,"language":"R","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2989},{"name":"clarketm/realtime-twitter-feed","owner":"clarketm","html_url":"https://github.com/clarketm/realtime-twitter-feed","stars":6,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":"Realtime Twitter feed using Angular2, Twitter, Google Maps, Express, and Socket.io","topics":["angular2","express","google-maps","socket-io","twitter"],"score":2989},{"name":"jamalmazrui/EdSharp","owner":"jamalmazrui","html_url":"https://github.com/jamalmazrui/EdSharp","stars":6,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Text and code editor optimized for keyboard and screen reader users","topics":[],"score":2989},{"name":"cshasha/veatch_2022","owner":"cshasha","html_url":"https://github.com/cshasha/veatch_2022","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":3,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2989},{"name":"vsivsi/meteor-job-collection-playground-worker","owner":"vsivsi","html_url":"https://github.com/vsivsi/meteor-job-collection-playground-worker","stars":5,"forks":4,"issues":1,"language":"CoffeeScript","description":"Sample node.js worker that will connect to a running jcPlayground","topics":[],"score":2989},{"name":"MechaDragonX/GameDiscLoader","owner":"MechaDragonX","html_url":"https://github.com/MechaDragonX/GameDiscLoader","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"A program that reads a PlayStation 2 game in the disc drive, creates an ISO file, and launches the PCSX2 emulator with it.
