Student teams will work to develop a desktop application for the streamlining of generative graphics creation -- essentially a User Interface tool that will be used to extend an extant Unity project which currently uses a Microsoft Kinect sensor to track actor movements on stage and generate graphics to augment the scene or actually create entirely new interactive environments. A primary goal for this novel software tool is that it allows for the quick alteration of perimeters in generative algorithms, enabling theatrical scenic designers to edit and design in real time during rehearsal, thus creating the conditions for a more fully integrated and collaborative design process with the director, actors, and other designers.

is important for insurance companies to estimate the risk involved while covering a future customer. Predicting the chances of insurance claim for a future customer allows the company to avoid adding potentially loss making customers. It also helps in determining appropriate monthly charges form the insured person or object. Through this project I try to build a prediction model for a car insurance company to predict the chances of loss making insurance deal based on the details of the car. A major challenge in this project is associated with the number of claims in the training data, only about 0.7% of the data has cars that have claimed insurance. Though this small claim percentage seem insignificant bu the cost requires to cover these insurance could cost the company millions of dollars. To address this challenge, I try to implement sampling techniques to increase the percentage of claim data.
