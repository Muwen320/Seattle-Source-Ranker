Predicting the chances of insurance claim for a future customer allows the company to avoid adding potentially loss making customers. It also helps in determining appropriate monthly charges form the insured person or object. Through this project I try to build a prediction model for a car insurance company to predict the chances of loss making insurance deal based on the details of the car. A major challenge in this project is associated with the number of claims in the training data, only about 0.7% of the data has cars that have claimed insurance. Though this small claim percentage seem insignificant bu the cost requires to cover these insurance could cost the company millions of dollars. To address this challenge, I try to implement sampling techniques to increase the percentage of claim data.  Language: R  Repository contains: Test and Training data files, R code and a detailed project report conveying challenges in the data and approach to build a final prediction model.","topics":[],"score":3618},{"name":"shehio/Computational-Finance","owner":"shehio","html_url":"https://github.com/shehio/Computational-Finance","stars":12,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"MATLAB","description":null,"topics":["almgren-chriss","bootstrapping-statistics","computational-finance","financial-economics","financial-engineering","markowitz-portfolio","modern-portfolio-theory","monte-carlo","monte-carlo-integration","monte-carlo-sampling","monte-carlo-simulation","optimal-control","optimal-execution","stochastic-optima","yield-curve"],"score":3618},{"name":"Dawilly/SAAT","owner":"Dawilly","html_url":"https://github.com/Dawilly/SAAT","stars":4,"forks":8,"issues":1,"language":"C#","description":"Stardew Valley Audio API & Toolkit","topics":[],"score":3618},{"name":"madhadron/mvc_for_the_web","owner":"madhadron","html_url":"https://github.com/madhadron/mvc_for_the_web","stars":34,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Example programs explaining the techniques of Model-View-Controller implemented as web applications.","topics":[],"score":3617},{"name":"biasedbit/xcode-themes","owner":"biasedbit","html_url":"https://github.com/biasedbit/xcode-themes","stars":29,"forks":4,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Custom themes for Xcode","topics":[],"score":3617},{"name":"cabanier/webxr-body-tracking","owner":"cabanier","html_url":"https://github.com/cabanier/webxr-body-tracking","stars":9,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Bikeshed","description":null,"topics":[],"score":3617},{"name":"FasterXML/Hacktoberfest2020","owner":"FasterXML","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/Hacktoberfest2020","stars":7,"forks":8,"issues":3,"language":null,"description":"Central repository for FasterXML activities related to Hacktoberfest 2020 by DigitalOcean (https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)","topics":["hacktoberfest","jackson"],"score":3617},{"name":"codefellows/seattle-python-401n2","owner":"codefellows","html_url":"https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-python-401n2","stars":5,"forks":15,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":3617},{"name":"richbl/remote-copy","owner":"richbl","html_url":"https://github.com/richbl/remote-copy","stars":10,"forks":4,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":"Backward-compatible upgrade to remote-folder-copy, a bash script to securely copy file(s)/folder(s) from a remote server","topics":["bash","bash-script","copy","remote","remote-copy","scp","shell","shell-script","sshpass"],"score":3616},{"name":"alofgran/Drug-Price-Prediction","owner":"alofgran","html_url":"https://github.com/alofgran/Drug-Price-Prediction","stars":10,"forks":5,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Pharmaceutical Drug Price Predictor","topics":[],"score":3616},{"name":"f5devcentral/f5xc-aws-ce-custom","owner":"f5devcentral","html_url":"https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5xc-aws-ce-custom","stars":7,"forks":4,"issues":0,"language":"HCL","description":null,"topics":[],"score":3616},{"name":"snakajima/game-compiler","owner":"snakajima","html_url":"https://github.com/snakajima/game-compiler","stars":22,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Game 80 compiler, which I've created when I was 18 ('79)","topics":[],"score":3615},{"name":"rlmark/comonadic_life","owner":"rlmark","html_url":"https://github.com/rlmark/comonadic_life","stars":17,"forks":4,"issues":1,"language":"Scala","description":null,"topics":[],"score":3615},{"name":"ianmah/cryptostory","owner":"ianmah","html_url":"https://github.com/ianmah/cryptostory","stars":14,"forks":5,"issues":1,"language":"Solidity","description":"nft hackathon project. collect playable characters and items on the blockchain.
