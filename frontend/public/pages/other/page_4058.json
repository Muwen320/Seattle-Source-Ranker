The software package includes a computerized representation of 3-dimensional seismic wave speed for Earth's crust and shallow mantle (the outer-most 100 to 200 km of the Earth) and algorithms to calculate travel times for waves that are commonly used to locate events. RSTT was designed with real-time monitoring in mind and travel times can be computed on the fly in approximately 1
