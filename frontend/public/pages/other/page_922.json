Notebook","description":"Due to their unique longevity and capacity to secrete high levels of protein, plasma B cells play have the potential to be used as a cell therapy for protein replacement. Here, we show that ex vivo engineered human plasma cells exhibited transcriptional and ultrastructural features of long-lived plasma cells and migrated to the bone marrow in immunodeficient mice. After transferring human plasma cells to immunodeficient mice in the presence of the human cytokines BAFF and IL6, we observed increases in retention of plasma cells in the bone marrow, with engraftment exceeding a year. The most profound in vivo effects of human IL6 were observed within 20 days of transfer and could be explained by decreased apoptosis in newly differentiated plasma cells. Collectively, these results show that ex vivo engineered and differentiated human plasma cells have the potential for long-lived in vivo protein secretion, which can be modeled in small animals.","topics":[],"score":2278},{"name":"asnow003/shuttle","owner":"asnow003","html_url":"https://github.com/asnow003/shuttle","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2278},{"name":"silvanoross/NLP_TF_IDF_Review","owner":"silvanoross","html_url":"https://github.com/silvanoross/NLP_TF_IDF_Review","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"This notebook transforms an assignment that I completed in the first quarter of my Data Science certificate program to use NLP for analyzing music lyrics.","topics":[],"score":2278},{"name":"chalseokorom/steel_plate_defect_prediction","owner":"chalseokorom","html_url":"https://github.com/chalseokorom/steel_plate_defect_prediction","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2278},{"name":"mmerani/videoMAE_testing","owner":"mmerani","html_url":"https://github.com/mmerani/videoMAE_testing","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2278},{"name":"mmerani/chatgpt_finetunning_workout_data","owner":"mmerani","html_url":"https://github.com/mmerani/chatgpt_finetunning_workout_data","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2278},{"name":"CascadeColin/product-review-card","owner":"CascadeColin","html_url":"https://github.com/CascadeColin/product-review-card","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2278},{"name":"JoeS51/Johannes-Website","owner":"JoeS51","html_url":"https://github.com/JoeS51/Johannes-Website","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2278},{"name":"jeremy-beasley/wear-os","owner":"jeremy-beasley","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremy-beasley/wear-os","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":2,"language":"Shell","description":"Tools and things for wear-os","topics":[],"score":2278},{"name":"chrisbanas/Bike_Rack_Demo_Assets","owner":"chrisbanas","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisbanas/Bike_Rack_Demo_Assets","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"My first demo build at Logik.io.
