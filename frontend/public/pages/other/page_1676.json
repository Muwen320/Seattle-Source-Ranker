world of technology is changing. It used to be one where users could post on social media, order clothes online, and play mobile games without a care in the world. As time progressed, companies eventually realized that they could collect small pieces of information from a user\u2019s technological habits, and use that to form a profile of the user of some sort. I used a packet-monitoring service to listen in on third-party applications and wrote a script to filter out relevant pieces of data that were being sent back to an application\u2019s server. The findings of this study concluded that third-party iOS applications have unmonitored power to access pieces of information like contacts, location, and emails.","score":2194},{"name":"CryFecteau/nucamp-site","owner":"CryFecteau","html_url":"https://github.com/CryFecteau/nucamp-site","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"CryFecteau/nucamp","owner":"CryFecteau","html_url":"https://github.com/CryFecteau/nucamp","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"carlybeefbarley/Tindog3","owner":"carlybeefbarley","html_url":"https://github.com/carlybeefbarley/Tindog3","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"carlybeefbarley/Tindog2","owner":"carlybeefbarley","html_url":"https://github.com/carlybeefbarley/Tindog2","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"carlybeefbarley/Tindog","owner":"carlybeefbarley","html_url":"https://github.com/carlybeefbarley/Tindog","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"emilysellinger/markdown-portfolio","owner":"emilysellinger","html_url":"https://github.com/emilysellinger/markdown-portfolio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"QuietImCoding/touchinggrass","owner":"QuietImCoding","html_url":"https://github.com/QuietImCoding/touchinggrass","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2194},{"name":"CarterKekoa/advancedQuerySQL","owner":"CarterKekoa","html_url":"https://github.com/CarterKekoa/advancedQuerySQL","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"More advanced query work with pre-made data sets.","score":2194},{"name":"CarterKekoa/tablesQueriesSQL","owner":"CarterKekoa","html_url":"https://github.com/CarterKekoa/tablesQueriesSQL","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Tables created from database schema provided in pdf.
