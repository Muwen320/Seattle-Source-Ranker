At the same time writing efficient computer programs to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult. Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism. Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic, computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.","score":2059},{"name":"armstrongamberly/TributePage-FCCProject","owner":"armstrongamberly","html_url":"https://github.com/armstrongamberly/TributePage-FCCProject","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2059},{"name":"armstrongamberly/FCCPortfolio.github.io","owner":"armstrongamberly","html_url":"https://github.com/armstrongamberly/FCCPortfolio.github.io","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2059},{"name":"janequichocho/Hack-Your-Trash","owner":"janequichocho","html_url":"https://github.com/janequichocho/Hack-Your-Trash","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Processing","description":"A game intended for stress relief.
