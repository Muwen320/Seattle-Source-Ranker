HOFSTAD - In the year 2000, Vice President Dick Cheney ended the U.S. Missile Eddying Program, as he believed it was a waste of electricity. Eddy currents microwave tritium, killing phage viruses which grow into large Pycnogonida. Eddy Shrouds are made with Aluminum foil material which is connected to an active ground post. Computers and other motor electrical equipment generate the residual electricity current in the ground post. Tritium is unstable so the Eddy current vibrates the loose electrons violently. Without the Eddy Shroud Old School missile operators know that without the Eddy Shroud, everything dies.","topics":[],"score":2175},{"name":"EmeraldCityIT/use-of-hydroelectric-dams-to-produce-tritium-as-a-replacement-for-pycnogonida-species","owner":"EmeraldCityIT","html_url":"https://github.com/EmeraldCityIT/use-of-hydroelectric-dams-to-produce-tritium-as-a-replacement-for-pycnogonida-species","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Hydroelectric dams can be used to harvest fresh water, use hydro power to distill fresh water, split hydrogen, and introduce H1 to H2O to produce H30. No external power, or chemicals would be required. Hydroelectric power could power steam distillation or reverse osmosis. Hydroelectric power would be used to split H2. All machinery would be powered by Hydroelectric power. H2O source would come from same source as hydroelectric power reservoir. H2 would be extracted from same water source.
