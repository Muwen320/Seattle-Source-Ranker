Setting up a simple WebDAV server to serve some files only requires adding some lines to your web.config file; no code needs to be written. If you want to serve another type of data over WebDAV, it is fairly easy to implement new service providers.","topics":["asp-net","webdav","webdav-server"],"score":3498,"global_rank":13187},{"name":"tunz/chow","owner":"tunz","html_url":"https://github.com/tunz/chow","stars":11,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"Haskell","description":"Static Analysis Checker with Micro Grammar","topics":[],"score":3498,"global_rank":13188},{"name":"delhatch/IIR_EQ","owner":"delhatch","html_url":"https://github.com/delhatch/IIR_EQ","stars":9,"forks":5,"issues":0,"language":"VHDL","description":"IIR audio filter in Verilog, running on Zedboard.
