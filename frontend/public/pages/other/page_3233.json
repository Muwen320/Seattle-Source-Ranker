points of emphasis for this lab was to gain familiarity with the IAR workbench software development environment, program the EK-TM4C123 board, learn the basics of the general-purpose input and output (GPIO), and perform simple digital I/O input and output. All the software written for this lab was done in C which helped in the understanding of pointers and how they are used to address certain GPIO registers. To extract the necessary information on these registers and Launchpad parts it was imperative to utilize the data sheet given.
