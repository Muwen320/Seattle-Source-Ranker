The hydroturbine's electricity generation capabilities would power the induction heating surfaces to boiling temperatures. As the water reaches boiling temperatures as it drops from the penstock into the hydro turbine, it's expansion would increase the turbine speed at much greater velocities that the water would without expansion.
