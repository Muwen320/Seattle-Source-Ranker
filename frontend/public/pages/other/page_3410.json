This program, as well as the details of its impact, are described in the paper \"School subsidies for the poor: evaluating the Mexican Progresa poverty program\", by Paul Shultz (available on Canvas). The goal of this problem set is to implement some of the basic econometric techniques to measure the impact of Progresa on secondary school enrollment rates. The timeline of the program was: Baseline survey conducted in 1997 Intervention begins in 1998, \"Wave 1\" of data collected in 1998 \"Wave 2 of data\" collected in 1999 Evaluation ends in 2000, at which point the control villages were treated. The data is the actual data collected to evaluate the impact of the Progresa program. In this file, each row corresponds to an observation taken for a given child for a given year. There are two years of data (1997 and 1998), and just under 40,000 children who are surveyed in each year.","score":1893},{"name":"hcrlab/access_teleop_msgs","owner":"hcrlab","html_url":"https://github.com/hcrlab/access_teleop_msgs","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CMake","description":"Messages
