Tut-Tut will be able to detect a raindrop of any size, get an idea of the drop's mass from the intensity at which it falls, and detect the frequency of raindrops. After Tut-Tut gathers this data, it will be able to wirelessly transmit the information to a central server and communicate it to other IoT devices around Oregon State University. The detector will periodically wake up to check for rain and will stay awake as long as rain is detected within two minutes. If it does not detect raindrops within two minutes, it will go back to sleep.","topics":[],"score":2521,"global_rank":58862},{"name":"ssharif6/Park-N-Go","owner":"ssharif6","html_url":"https://github.com/ssharif6/Park-N-Go","stars":1,"forks":2,"watchers":6,"issues":1,"language":"Objective-C","description":"A
