In this approach, once the flow management has been defined, the only way to make an adjustment to the policy is via reconfiguration of the devices. With increasing use of mobile devices, the scaling of networks as per changing traffic demands is restricted by this approach. Software Defined Networks (SDN) is a process where the control is moved out of the individual network nodes and into the separate centralized controller. The controller can hence, exploit complete knowledge of the network to optimize flow management and support user requirements. A custom network topology is created in our project and by using a centralized SDN controller, the network is controlled. After programming the network in tune with our application, packets are generated to test different applications that we developed on the SDN. This project demonstrates the different capabilities of SDN, by implementing 3 major network applications- SDN switch as a hub, SDN switch as a Firewall, and Selective Routing using SDN.","topics":[],"score":2988,"global_rank":26841},{"name":"BatuhanGumus/BatuhanGumus","owner":"BatuhanGumus","html_url":"https://github.com/BatuhanGumus/BatuhanGumus","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"my profile README","topics":[],"score":2988,"global_rank":26849},{"name":"mohseenrm/dotfiles","owner":"mohseenrm","html_url":"https://github.com/mohseenrm/dotfiles","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Lua","description":"Repo for dev setup on machines","topics":[],"score":2988,"global_rank":26851},{"name":"faisalkhan91/Fluxus","owner":"faisalkhan91","html_url":"https://github.com/faisalkhan91/Fluxus","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"This is my personal profile and blogging application.","topics":[],"score":2988,"global_rank":26852},{"name":"davidlazar/haskell-semantics","owner":"davidlazar","html_url":"https://github.com/davidlazar/haskell-semantics","stars":15,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Haskell","description":"Formal semantics of Haskell in K","topics":[],"score":2987,"global_rank":26854},{"name":"mattnigh/copilot_issue_templates","owner":"mattnigh","html_url":"https://github.com/mattnigh/copilot_issue_templates","stars":11,"forks":1,"issues":2,"language":null,"description":"A repo for Issue templates that use Copilot + AI to accomplish tasks","topics":[],"score":2987,"global_rank":26855},{"name":"agocke/json-serializer","owner":"agocke","html_url":"https://github.com/agocke/json-serializer","stars":10,"forks":2,"issues":1,"language":"C#","description":"Prototype for a JSON serializer library based on Roslyn future source generators","topics":[],"score":2987,"global_rank":26858},{"name":"viirya/parquet-tools","owner":"viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/parquet-tools","stars":8,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":"parquet-tools and dependency jar files","topics":[],"score":2987,"global_rank":26860},{"name":"mgutz/bake","owner":"mgutz","html_url":"https://github.com/mgutz/bake","stars":6,"forks":5,"issues":1,"language":"Shell","description":"Bash make utility","topics":[],"score":2987,"global_rank":26862},{"name":"cshasha/veatch_2022","owner":"cshasha","html_url":"https://github.com/cshasha/veatch_2022","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":3,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2987,"global_rank":26864},{"name":"MechaDragonX/GameDiscLoader","owner":"MechaDragonX","html_url":"https://github.com/MechaDragonX/GameDiscLoader","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"A program that reads a PlayStation 2 game in the disc drive, creates an ISO file, and launches the PCSX2 emulator with it.
