Your firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, your firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.  The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. You\u2019re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm\u2019s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, you\u2019ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.","topics":[],"score":2168},{"name":"WillDittig/Fintech_Challenge_Module_10","owner":"WillDittig","html_url":"https://github.com/WillDittig/Fintech_Challenge_Module_10","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"You\u2019ll create a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods.
