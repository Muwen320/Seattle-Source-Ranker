Methionine was the most tolerated substitution while proline was the least tolerated. Histidine and asparagine best recapitulated the effects of other substitutions, even when the identity of the wild type amino acid was considered. Furthermore, highly disruptive substitutions like aspartic and glutamic acid had the most discriminatory power for detecting ligand interface positions. Our work highlights the utility of large-scale mutagenesis data, and our conclusions can help guide future mutagenesis studies.","topics":[],"score":2351},{"name":"JonathanRaiman/autodraw","owner":"JonathanRaiman","html_url":"https://github.com/JonathanRaiman/autodraw","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2351},{"name":"jiyuhan/summerProject","owner":"jiyuhan","html_url":"https://github.com/jiyuhan/summerProject","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":2,"language":"Arduino","description":null,"topics":["arducam","arduino","c","c-plus-plus","ov7670","summer-project"],"score":2351},{"name":"matthuhiggins/dotfiles","owner":"matthuhiggins","html_url":"https://github.com/matthuhiggins/dotfiles","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2351},{"name":"mkmar01/batbrain7.github.io","owner":"mkmar01","html_url":"https://github.com/mkmar01/batbrain7.github.io","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":"My portfolio website","topics":[],"score":2351},{"name":"Sage-Bionetworks/clearScience-demo","owner":"Sage-Bionetworks","html_url":"https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/clearScience-demo","stars":1,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"R","description":"Code stored for the mocked up version of clearScience -- a real analysis with actual objects stored in Synapse","topics":[],"score":2351},{"name":"willnx/vlab","owner":"willnx","html_url":"https://github.com/willnx/vlab","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":11,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2351},{"name":"ftan84/twitter-sentiment-R","owner":"ftan84","html_url":"https://github.com/ftan84/twitter-sentiment-R","stars":1,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"R","description":"Twitter sentiment analysis using R","topics":[],"score":2351},{"name":"manickaa/CS290","owner":"manickaa","html_url":"https://github.com/manickaa/CS290","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":5,"language":"HTML","description":"A simple static web page for CS290(web development) final project","topics":[],"score":2351},{"name":"Dustin-Ray/Differentially-Private-DGA-Detection","owner":"Dustin-Ray","html_url":"https://github.com/Dustin-Ray/Differentially-Private-DGA-Detection","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Produces a differentially-private model for domain generation algorithm detection.
