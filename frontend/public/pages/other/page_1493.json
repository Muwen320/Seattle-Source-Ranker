Methionine was the most tolerated substitution while proline was the least tolerated. Histidine and asparagine best recapitulated the effects of other substitutions, even when the identity of the wild type amino acid was considered. Furthermore, highly disruptive substitutions like aspartic and glutamic acid had the most discriminatory power for detecting ligand interface positions. Our work highlights the utility of large-scale mutagenesis data, and our conclusions can help guide future mutagenesis studies.","topics":[],"score":1940.8000000000002,"global_rank":337769},{"name":"ghost-language/vscode","owner":"ghost-language","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost-language/vscode","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":1,"language":"Other","description":"An extension for VS Code which provides support for Ghost","topics":["ghost","vscode"],"score":1940.8000000000002,"global_rank":337770},{"name":"ursky/review_paper","owner":"ursky","html_url":"https://github.com/ursky/review_paper","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"Documents for preparing the manuscript of \"Applying genome-resolved metagenomics to de-convolute the halophilic microbiome\"","topics":[],"score":1940.8000000000002,"global_rank":337771},{"name":"clarketm/HackerRank-SQL","owner":"clarketm","html_url":"https://github.com/clarketm/HackerRank-SQL","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"HackerRank SQL Solutions","topics":["hackerrank","solutions","sql"],"score":1940.8000000000002,"global_rank":337772},{"name":"mnbatra/pr-demo","owner":"mnbatra","html_url":"https://github.com/mnbatra/pr-demo","stars":0,"forks":1,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1940.8000000000002,"global_rank":337773},{"name":"min0k/min0k","owner":"min0k","html_url":"https://github.com/min0k/min0k","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"Config files for my GitHub profile.","topics":["config","github-config"],"score":1940.8000000000002,"global_rank":337774},{"name":"dbpatnode/dbpatnode","owner":"dbpatnode","html_url":"https://github.com/dbpatnode/dbpatnode","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1940.8000000000002,"global_rank":337775},{"name":"gadamc/gadamc.github.io","owner":"gadamc","html_url":"https://github.com/gadamc/gadamc.github.io","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1940.8000000000002,"global_rank":337776}]
