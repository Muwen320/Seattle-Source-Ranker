The robot contain basic mapping and navigation functions, with addtional model in simulation software, voice control and voie feedback, set tarket with coordinate and so on. Finally, thanks for my teamates, Hao Lan, Yuchen Luo, Diwen Miao and Wuxin Shen. I roughly upload the whole workspace and I think you will be clear with how it work if you are already familar with ROS. And if not, maybe it is a good idea for you to check the catkin_ws/src/hunter/lacunh first. And I will add more description in README.
