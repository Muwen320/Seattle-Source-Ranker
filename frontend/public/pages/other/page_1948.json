Since Kickstarter only makes money once a project has passed its goal \u2013 and has been deemed a success \u2013 it is already in their best interests to only have successful campaigns. But if there were a way to determine which campaigns would be extremely successful \u2013 and could theoretically be even more successful with the right publicity on their end \u2013 Kickstarter would find this information extremely valuable. We could also provide a service to a prospective user of a crowdfunding campaign, on ways that they can optimize their campaign itself to give themselves the best chance of being successful.","topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"ashishakonnur/YouTube-trends-for-2017-2018---Intro-to-Python","owner":"ashishakonnur","html_url":"https://github.com/ashishakonnur/YouTube-trends-for-2017-2018---Intro-to-Python","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"webern/nvidia-hack","owner":"webern","html_url":"https://github.com/webern/nvidia-hack","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Smarty","description":"A fork of https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator using the published tarball as the starting point.","topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"webern/nvidia-driver-images","owner":"webern","html_url":"https://github.com/webern/nvidia-driver-images","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":"Fork of https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/driver.git","topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"ChunyiKoo/git_test","owner":"ChunyiKoo","html_url":"https://github.com/ChunyiKoo/git_test","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"MarquesaAsmussen/javascript-401d44-class-41","owner":"MarquesaAsmussen","html_url":"https://github.com/MarquesaAsmussen/javascript-401d44-class-41","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"evi-liu/repo","owner":"evi-liu","html_url":"https://github.com/evi-liu/repo","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"rockper/mlenano","owner":"rockper","html_url":"https://github.com/rockper/mlenano","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Projects for Udacity Machine Learning Engineer NanoDegree","topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"SwapnikKatkoori/netflix-vidchat","owner":"SwapnikKatkoori","html_url":"https://github.com/SwapnikKatkoori/netflix-vidchat","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Chrome extension for Netflix that allows users to video chat while watching.","topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"WeiWei22223/data-structure-visualization","owner":"WeiWei22223","html_url":"https://github.com/WeiWei22223/data-structure-visualization","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"A website that can visualize simple data structures.
