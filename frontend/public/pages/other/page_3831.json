It can be described using the following formula.  MT = a + b \u00d7 ID;  ID = log2(2A/W)  Where MT is task completion time, ID is the index of difficulty, A (amplitude) is the distance to the center of the target and W (width) is the width of the (square) target. This program will help us to collect data so that we can calculate the coefficients a and b in the future.
