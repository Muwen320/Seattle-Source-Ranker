We are also interested in which of the two treatments (cognitive-behavioral or social) is superior in elongating relapse time compared to the other. We reviewed a total of 576 alcoholic patients and used a Cox PH model to analyze a range of genetic and environmental factors.   We concluded that family support, prior number of alcohol treatments, type of treatment,  age, and the interaction between age and prior number of treatments were significant factors that influenced relapse time. Specifically, stronger family support, more prior treatments, younger ages were associated with a higher hazard of relapse to alcoholism. We also found the treatment emphasizing cognitive behavioral therapy improved relapse time more than social therapy.

Implementing a logistic regression on the dataset, the final model of significant predictors included age, impulsivity, weight loss goal, amount of meditation, and the interactions among age and amount of meditation, impulsivity and amount of meditation, and weight loss goal and impulsivity. Of these factors, higher weight loss goals, low impulsivity, and meditating a medium amount per day all contributed positively to weight loss. For all ages in this \u201cmiddle-aged\u201d category, meditating a low or medium amount per day also contributed positively to weight loss; however, for subjects with low impulsivity, meditating a low or medium amount per day contributed negatively to weight loss.","score":1897},{"name":"annasxu/google_trend_data","owner":"annasxu","html_url":"https://github.com/annasxu/google_trend_data","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"In this paper, we used time series analysis to analyze data on how frequently \u201cNetflix\u201d is searched for in Google over time.
