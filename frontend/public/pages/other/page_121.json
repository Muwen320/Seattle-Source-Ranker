They are vital for organizations, customers, industries, and communities to network, make announcements, offer educational opportunities, increase sales and account support, and provide opportunities for connection.   To comply with and support sustainable and zero-waste commitments, intentional practices must be implemented to events and community-driven experiences. Sustainability must be fully integrated into the strategy, planning, programming, logistics, operations, and execution. Additionally, diversity, equity, inclusivity, and environmental justice must be prioritized by generating significant impact through awareness, community-driven initiatives, and commitments.","score":3346},{"name":"digitalcolony/ineedcoffee-archive","owner":"digitalcolony","html_url":"https://github.com/digitalcolony/ineedcoffee-archive","stars":6,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Astro","description":"\u2615 Archive for INeedCoffee.com","score":3346},{"name":"MazamaScience/MazamaSpatialUtils","owner":"MazamaScience","html_url":"https://github.com/MazamaScience/MazamaSpatialUtils","stars":5,"forks":2,"issues":10,"language":"R","description":"Harmonized spatial datasets and spatial search functions","score":3346},{"name":"kearnsw/bime-591","owner":"kearnsw","html_url":"https://github.com/kearnsw/bime-591","stars":5,"forks":5,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Conversational Agents in Healthcare","score":3346},{"name":"eywalker/Lviv-2021","owner":"eywalker","html_url":"https://github.com/eywalker/Lviv-2021","stars":5,"forks":3,"issues":1,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Course material for \"Deep Learning in Neuroscience\" offers as part of Lviv Data Science Summer School 2021.","score":3346},{"name":"tomtrogdon/AKNS.jl","owner":"tomtrogdon","html_url":"https://github.com/tomtrogdon/AKNS.jl","stars":4,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Scattering and inverse scattering for the AKNS system","score":3346},{"name":"Terminator-J/crdroid_device_oneplus_enchilada","owner":"Terminator-J","html_url":"https://github.com/Terminator-J/crdroid_device_oneplus_enchilada","stars":2,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Makefile","description":"Personal repo for working on things prior to merging into official crDroid repositories.
