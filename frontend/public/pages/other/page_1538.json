Image processing is integrated to perform the object detection. IBM Watson Visual Recognition tool is used to train an image processing model using five object classes. The complete flow is devised using Node-Red which is a flow-based development tool for visual programming. IBM Watson IoT platform is used to visualize multiple user related fields. A Restful API based server is separately created for database integration and getting results from different queries required in the flow.
