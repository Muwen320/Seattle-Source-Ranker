The law standardizes this process by requiring building owners to enter their annual energy and water use in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) online tool, ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager\u00ae and use the tool to submit data to the City. This data informs building owners about a building's energy and water consumption compared to similar buildings, and tracks progress year over year to help in energy efficiency planning.  Benchmarking data is also disclosed publicly, analyzed in reports, visualized in the NYC Energy and Water Performance Map, included in energy efficiency policy development efforts such as the Buildings Technical Working Group Final Report, and used to develop free resources such as the NYC Retrofit Accelerator and Community Retrofit NYC to help building owners use less energy and save money.  Local Law 33 of 2018 amended the Administrative Code of the City of New York in relation to energy efficiency scores and grades for buildings required to benchmark their energy and water consumption. Energy efficiency scores and grades for these buildings shall be obtained, assigned and disclosed in accordance with the new section \u00a728-309.12 annually, based on benchmarking reporting consistent with Federal energy efficiency standards.  An energy efficiency score is the Energy Star Rating that a building earns using the United States Environmental Protection Agency online benchmarking tool, Energy Star Portfolio Manager, to compare building energy performance to similar buildings in similar climates.","score":2595},{"name":"darshana-mis/Python_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Spotify","owner":"darshana-mis","html_url":"https://github.com/darshana-mis/Python_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Spotify","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"score":2595},{"name":"FredHutch/bcftools-docker","owner":"FredHutch","html_url":"https://github.com/FredHutch/bcftools-docker","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Dockerfile","description":null,"score":2595},{"name":"FredHutch/bwa-docker","owner":"FredHutch","html_url":"https://github.com/FredHutch/bwa-docker","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Dockerfile","description":null,"score":2595},{"name":"RyanCavanaugh/lets-make-an-inference-algorithm","owner":"RyanCavanaugh","html_url":"https://github.com/RyanCavanaugh/lets-make-an-inference-algorithm","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Vue","description":null,"score":2595},{"name":"mkheck/ppp-deploy-scripts","owner":"mkheck","html_url":"https://github.com/mkheck/ppp-deploy-scripts","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":"Deployment scripts (shell, using az cli) for use deploying to Azure Container Apps using either az cli (entirely) or just to init variables for subsequent Terraform, etc. deployment","score":2595},{"name":"vanmeciv/vanmeciv","owner":"vanmeciv","html_url":"https://github.com/vanmeciv/vanmeciv","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2595},{"name":"sagemathinc/bmcs-course","owner":"sagemathinc","html_url":"https://github.com/sagemathinc/bmcs-course","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Brittle Matrix Composite Structures","score":2595},{"name":"Wilder101/Wilder101.github.io","owner":"Wilder101","html_url":"https://github.com/Wilder101/Wilder101.github.io","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Wilder Molyneux, Full Stack Web Developer","score":2595},{"name":"mattxwang/assp-bridge","owner":"mattxwang","html_url":"https://github.com/mattxwang/assp-bridge","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"tinkering for assp bridge!","score":2595},{"name":"Soester10/atom-finder","owner":"Soester10","html_url":"https://github.com/Soester10/atom-finder","stars":0,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"CodeQL","description":"Tool to find the Atoms of Confusion in a project","score":2595},{"name":"enkhe/enkhe.github.io","owner":"enkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/enkhe/enkhe.github.io","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Software Engineer","score":2595},{"name":"Ella-Kim913/Ella-Kim913","owner":"Ella-Kim913","html_url":"https://github.com/Ella-Kim913/Ella-Kim913","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Config files for my GitHub profile.","score":2595},{"name":"UW-GAC/primed-inventory-workflows","owner":"UW-GAC","html_url":"https://github.com/UW-GAC/primed-inventory-workflows","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"R","description":"Workflows for generating the PRIMED inventory workspace","score":2595},{"name":"TommyUnger/tommyunger.github.io","owner":"TommyUnger","html_url":"https://github.com/TommyUnger/tommyunger.github.io","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"personal website for Tommy Unger","score":2595},{"name":"jorgenpt/ObjectiveMetrics","owner":"jorgenpt","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgenpt/ObjectiveMetrics","stars":18,"forks":1,"issues":14,"language":"Objective-C","description":"Objective-C component for the DeskMetrics analytics service","score":2594},{"name":"Ebiltwin/Rubysan","owner":"Ebiltwin","html_url":"https://github.com/Ebiltwin/Rubysan","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"ruby logo for Aaron Patterson","score":2594},{"name":"briandotnet/AutoLayoutScrollViewExperiment","owner":"briandotnet","html_url":"https://github.com/briandotnet/AutoLayoutScrollViewExperiment","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Objective-C","description":"Experimenting with auto layout and scroll view with dynamic size content programmatically without xib, with the help of FLKAutoLayout.
