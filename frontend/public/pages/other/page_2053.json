Since Kickstarter only makes money once a project has passed its goal \u2013 and has been deemed a success \u2013 it is already in their best interests to only have successful campaigns. But if there were a way to determine which campaigns would be extremely successful \u2013 and could theoretically be even more successful with the right publicity on their end \u2013 Kickstarter would find this information extremely valuable. We could also provide a service to a prospective user of a crowdfunding campaign, on ways that they can optimize their campaign itself to give themselves the best chance of being successful.","topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"tmoore53/Microsoft-WhiteBoarding","owner":"tmoore53","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoore53/Microsoft-WhiteBoarding","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"Binary Tree ","topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"tmoore53/Task-Manager-to-Database","owner":"tmoore53","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoore53/Task-Manager-to-Database","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"First application that interacts with a database","topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"hbod8/AudioVisualizer","owner":"hbod8","html_url":"https://github.com/hbod8/AudioVisualizer","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Makefile","description":"This project was a test of C window creation and audio file decryption and playback.","topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"Venkteshkavi/ruby-repo","owner":"Venkteshkavi","html_url":"https://github.com/Venkteshkavi/ruby-repo","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"playground for ruby snippets","topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"AndrewLiu66/VegeGO-Client-side","owner":"AndrewLiu66","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewLiu66/VegeGO-Client-side","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Vue","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"ddonco/docker-websockets-server","owner":"ddonco","html_url":"https://github.com/ddonco/docker-websockets-server","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"Jessica-Mach/improper-to-mixed-fraction","owner":"Jessica-Mach","html_url":"https://github.com/Jessica-Mach/improper-to-mixed-fraction","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"metanomial/wordnab","owner":"metanomial","html_url":"https://github.com/metanomial/wordnab","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"rugeli/rugeli","owner":"rugeli","html_url":"https://github.com/rugeli/rugeli","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Config files for my GitHub profile.","topics":["config","github-config"],"score":2171},{"name":"lyssg2/Portfolio-basic","owner":"lyssg2","html_url":"https://github.com/lyssg2/Portfolio-basic","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"lyssg2/conflict-resolution","owner":"lyssg2","html_url":"https://github.com/lyssg2/conflict-resolution","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"singh96aman/Kaggle---Credit-Risk-Assessment-","owner":"singh96aman","html_url":"https://github.com/singh96aman/Kaggle---Credit-Risk-Assessment-","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"This is repository to track the progress for problem statement https://www.kaggle.com/c/gs-l1-credit-risk-assessment#","topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"arjunsoota/C-Interview-Problems","owner":"arjunsoota","html_url":"https://github.com/arjunsoota/C-Interview-Problems","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2171},{"name":"ade-eba/ade-eba","owner":"ade-eba","html_url":"https://github.com/ade-eba/ade-eba","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"A little about me!
