These results appeared to be state of art in handwritten digit recognition. Architecture of each algorithm on dataset fits well and the accuracy of each classifier is show below in the table. Every algorithm provides impressive performance comparatively but when you consider accuracy of each classifier KNN comes out as superior. If you Consider time taken by each classifier as well as accuracy into account then Random Forest fits well as compared to KNN.","topics":[],"score":2371,"global_rank":91746},{"name":"brady800526/Practice-MySQL-Guestbook_Flask","owner":"brady800526","html_url":"https://github.com/brady800526/Practice-MySQL-Guestbook_Flask","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Build comment board for users to leave the comments and save to MySQL database","topics":[],"score":2371,"global_rank":91748},{"name":"mosquitozm100/QtMazeZM","owner":"mosquitozm100","html_url":"https://github.com/mosquitozm100/QtMazeZM","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Makefile","description":"Maze By Qt","topics":[],"score":2371,"global_rank":91752},{"name":"slb350/nixstats-ansible","owner":"slb350","html_url":"https://github.com/slb350/nixstats-ansible","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"A playbook for installing Nixstats","topics":[],"score":2371,"global_rank":91753},{"name":"david-grey/BESTAT","owner":"david-grey","html_url":"https://github.com/david-grey/BESTAT","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2371,"global_rank":91754},{"name":"stuartpb/stuartpb.plan","owner":"stuartpb","html_url":"https://github.com/stuartpb/stuartpb.plan","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"What Stuart P.
