Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.  For this exercise, our trigger word will be \"Activate.\" Every time it hears you say \"activate,\" it will make a \"chiming\" sound. By the end of this assignment, you will be able to record a clip of yourself talking, and have the algorithm trigger a chime when it detects you saying \"activate.\"","topics":[],"score":2868},{"name":"vasukumar92/Drone-Flight-Data-Anlaysis-and-Flight-Range-Prediciton-using-Neural-Networks","owner":"vasukumar92","html_url":"https://github.com/vasukumar92/Drone-Flight-Data-Anlaysis-and-Flight-Range-Prediciton-using-Neural-Networks","stars":4,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Understanding of the flight condition, performance, efficiency is a vital part of a company\u2019s strategy.
