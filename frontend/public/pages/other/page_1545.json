server should take 3 command line arguments: the port number from which it reads requests, the message size in bytes, and the sleep time in milliseconds. The server will read a message of the specified size from a client. After that, it will sleep for the specified amount of time (to simulate injected network latency) and then send an acknowledgment for the received message back to the client. Each client message will have a unique sequence number, which is included in the ack sent by the server. The server repeats this for 30 messages and then exit. The client will take 3 command line arguments: the IP address (or the host name) and port number of the server, and the message size in bytes. The client will write a message of the specified size to the server and wait for the ack from the server. The client will repeat this 30 times and keep track of the total amount of time spent on sending all the messages and receiving all the acks. It computes the throughput by: 30 * message_size_in_bytes / total_time_in_seconds and print the throughput value.
