In most cases, these deaths are due to the delay in the response we get from the external sources. In such situation, an automatic accident detection mechanism can help to save the loss of life. In this solution, we would demonstrate a prototype for automatic accident detection and prevention using Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) and Internet of Things (IoT).   We will be using off the shelf OBD devices to get diagnostics and real-time information of your car, smart bands for medical insights and your phone acting as a field gateway to communicate with the IoT Hub. The data we get from the phone and OBD device will be stored and analyzed using Azure services based on several inputs. This would enable meaningful insights on users driving behavior.   In case of emergency, nearby devices will be alerted immediately and a signal will be sent to our central server, which will send the location of the accident to the nearest emergency centers. This will also act as a base for smart traffic management system.","score":2089},{"name":"9999years/test","owner":"9999years","html_url":"https://github.com/9999years/test","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2089},{"name":"9999years/wifi","owner":"9999years","html_url":"https://github.com/9999years/wifi","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":null,"score":2089},{"name":"9999years/brandeis-course-data","owner":"9999years","html_url":"https://github.com/9999years/brandeis-course-data","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2089},{"name":"doopingen/doopingen.github.io","owner":"doopingen","html_url":"https://github.com/doopingen/doopingen.github.io","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2089},{"name":"doopingen/cf101","owner":"doopingen","html_url":"https://github.com/doopingen/cf101","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"cf-101-class","score":2089},{"name":"ianbruce/gojup","owner":"ianbruce","html_url":"https://github.com/ianbruce/gojup","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Dockerfile","description":null,"score":2089},{"name":"Williamsja0314/ecs-refarch-cloudformation","owner":"Williamsja0314","html_url":"https://github.com/Williamsja0314/ecs-refarch-cloudformation","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Makefile","description":null,"score":2089},{"name":"nohharri/jakeandcarly","owner":"nohharri","html_url":"https://github.com/nohharri/jakeandcarly","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"score":2089},{"name":"rajcspsg/ConcurrentProgrammingInScala","owner":"rajcspsg","html_url":"https://github.com/rajcspsg/ConcurrentProgrammingInScala","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Scala","description":"Concurrent
