This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights that can be used immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company. This data set provides information to help in predicting what behavior will help the company to retain customers. I have focused on analyzing all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.","topics":[],"score":2664,"global_rank":47804},{"name":"machineagency/fabscription","owner":"machineagency","html_url":"https://github.com/machineagency/fabscription","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Svelte","description":"Scrub video documentation, machine instructions, and source code of a fabrication process.
