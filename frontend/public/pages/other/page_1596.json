By doing multiple training sessions of button clicks (white or black) to indicate what was the most visible text, the artificial intelligence quickly mastered how to determine the solution.","topics":[],"score":2190},{"name":"klacewho/reading-notes","owner":"klacewho","html_url":"https://github.com/klacewho/reading-notes","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Notes for 401 Javascript","topics":[],"score":2190},{"name":"huynguyen7/Functional-Programming-in-Haskell","owner":"huynguyen7","html_url":"https://github.com/huynguyen7/Functional-Programming-in-Haskell","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Haskell","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2190},{"name":"zahraaliaghazadeh/hackerrank","owner":"zahraaliaghazadeh","html_url":"https://github.com/zahraaliaghazadeh/hackerrank","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Algorithm Practice on Hackerrank.","topics":[],"score":2190},{"name":"mjsabby/ConnectionFactoryTest","owner":"mjsabby","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsabby/ConnectionFactoryTest","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2190},{"name":"mjsabby/NetTraceGen","owner":"mjsabby","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsabby/NetTraceGen","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2190},{"name":"bsiegel/cmake-vcpkg-ios-sampleproj","owner":"bsiegel","html_url":"https://github.com/bsiegel/cmake-vcpkg-ios-sampleproj","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CMake","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2190},{"name":"scyto/docker-zwavejs2mqtt","owner":"scyto","html_url":"https://github.com/scyto/docker-zwavejs2mqtt","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"PowerShell","description":"My own repo to create and push nightly builds for my own use.","topics":[],"score":2190},{"name":"ROODAY/Grease-The-Groove","owner":"ROODAY","html_url":"https://github.com/ROODAY/Grease-The-Groove","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Webapp to track grease the groove progress","topics":[],"score":2190},{"name":"Megharth/resume-text","owner":"Megharth","html_url":"https://github.com/Megharth/resume-text","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"TeX","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2190},{"name":"d9zero/lab02","owner":"d9zero","html_url":"https://github.com/d9zero/lab02","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"301 lab 2","topics":[],"score":2190},{"name":"d9zero/lab-01","owner":"d9zero","html_url":"https://github.com/d9zero/lab-01","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":"301 lab 1","topics":[],"score":2190},{"name":"d9zero/Readingnotes301","owner":"d9zero","html_url":"https://github.com/d9zero/Readingnotes301","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2190},{"name":"madeby254/An-Online-Registration-Form","owner":"madeby254","html_url":"https://github.com/madeby254/An-Online-Registration-Form","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Treehouse Front End Techdegree Project 3.
