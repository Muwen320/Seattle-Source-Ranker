is actually the third and a half version of my ancient \"game\" library. The first version was intended to be a library that allowed games to be written portably for DOS or Windows. The second iteration dropped DOS support and focused on providing a lot of functionality for multimedia/graphical applications running under Windows, including streaming playback of many video and audio formats, scripting support, and other fancy things. The next version departed from the game genre and aimed to abstract away the operating system, allowing programs to be written portably. I got it compiling under Windows and Linux and had plans for other unixes, including Mac OS X to be supported as well. The game-specific parts weren't done, but the OS abstraction was working and very useful. Eventually, though, I realized that with mono coming along so nicely, I might as well build this atop the .NET framework, which would have the added benefit of being language-agnostic and not tying any potential users to C++ as well as reducing the amount of work I would have to do. After the advent of modern 3D games, I haven't updated this much, but it's still kinda useful.","topics":["game-development","gamedev","library"],"score":2771,"global_rank":38602},{"name":"javierluraschi/multiverse","owner":"javierluraschi","html_url":"https://github.com/javierluraschi/multiverse","stars":3,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"R","description":"A set of packages to scale data science workflows","topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38604},{"name":"thvasilo/thvasilo.github.io","owner":"thvasilo","html_url":"https://github.com/thvasilo/thvasilo.github.io","stars":3,"forks":0,"issues":3,"language":"SCSS","description":"Personal website/blog","topics":["blog","conference-notes","icdm","kdd","machine-learning","research"],"score":2771,"global_rank":38606},{"name":"mohitsriv/EasyAuthMultiTierSample","owner":"mohitsriv","html_url":"https://github.com/mohitsriv/EasyAuthMultiTierSample","stars":3,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"A three tier application, where backend auth is done in App Service instead of in code","topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38608},{"name":"joshuatz/scratchpad-playgrounds","owner":"joshuatz","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuatz/scratchpad-playgrounds","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Markdown","description":"Collection of prebuilt workspaces so you can *quickly* try out different languages and frameworks!","topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38617},{"name":"carissa406/deep-learning-535","owner":"carissa406","html_url":"https://github.com/carissa406/deep-learning-535","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Deep Learning","topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38618},{"name":"davidlucio/portfolio","owner":"davidlucio","html_url":"https://github.com/davidlucio/portfolio","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":"React Portfolio Landing Page","topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38621},{"name":"brendenwest/it212","owner":"brendenwest","html_url":"https://github.com/brendenwest/it212","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"IT 212 - Data Structures & Algorithms","topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38622},{"name":"giodamelio/tailscale-dns-terraform","owner":"giodamelio","html_url":"https://github.com/giodamelio/tailscale-dns-terraform","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HCL","description":"Create AWS Route53 records for you Tailscale Machines with Terraform","topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38623},{"name":"ejain/iron-deficiency","owner":"ejain","html_url":"https://github.com/ejain/iron-deficiency","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":["quantified-self"],"score":2771,"global_rank":38624},{"name":"averagewagon/data-tamers","owner":"averagewagon","html_url":"https://github.com/averagewagon/data-tamers","stars":2,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"The INFO-201 GitHub Repository for the Data Tamers group.","topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38629},{"name":"crazy4pi314/ml4all-quantum-perceptron","owner":"crazy4pi314","html_url":"https://github.com/crazy4pi314/ml4all-quantum-perceptron","stars":2,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"repo for code demoed in my talk for #ML4ALL 2019","topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38633},{"name":"ThomasGust/ScienceFair","owner":"ThomasGust","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasGust/ScienceFair","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Code for any of my science fair projects!","topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38636},{"name":"joshspicer/joshspicer","owner":"joshspicer","html_url":"https://github.com/joshspicer/joshspicer","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af","topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38638},{"name":"ashnehete/tpcc-web-server-py","owner":"ashnehete","html_url":"https://github.com/ashnehete/tpcc-web-server-py","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Webserver in Python for TPC-C benchmark","topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38642},{"name":"codefellows/seattle-code-javascript-401d55","owner":"codefellows","html_url":"https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-code-javascript-401d55","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack Javascript with lead instructor Jacob Knaack","topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38644},{"name":"keith/resume.keith.so","owner":"keith","html_url":"https://github.com/keith/resume.keith.so","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"SCSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2771,"global_rank":38646}]
