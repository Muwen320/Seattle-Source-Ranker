If there exists a specific pattern that can describe the interactions between the manufacturers and retailers, the application of causality analysis on their pricing interaction can clarify their strategic behavior. The interactions between the manufacturer and retailer can be discussed to follow a verticalintegrated system or Stackelberg leadership bilateral-monopoly model. In a vertical-integrated system, the manufacturer and retailer cooperate to maximize the profit of the distribution channel instead of individual profit. The important character of this model is that both the manufacturer and retailer affect the sales of the product.","topics":[],"score":1882,"global_rank":384089},{"name":"aarivan/music-recommender-system-","owner":"aarivan","html_url":"https://github.com/aarivan/music-recommender-system-","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"A music recommender system that will recommend new musical artists to a user based on their listening history.","topics":[],"score":1882,"global_rank":384091},{"name":"oonemo/hello-world","owner":"oonemo","html_url":"https://github.com/oonemo/hello-world","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"the first demo project","topics":[],"score":1882,"global_rank":384092},{"name":"dpalmasan/robotics_columbia_edx","owner":"dpalmasan","html_url":"https://github.com/dpalmasan/robotics_columbia_edx","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CMake","description":"A repo with my solution for project assignments in the Robotics course offered by Columbia University through edX","topics":[],"score":1882,"global_rank":384093},{"name":"zacscodingclub/retail-page","owner":"zacscodingclub","html_url":"https://github.com/zacscodingclub/retail-page","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1882,"global_rank":384098},{"name":"zacscodingclub/bboard-vue","owner":"zacscodingclub","html_url":"https://github.com/zacscodingclub/bboard-vue","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1882,"global_rank":384101},{"name":"pavelpark/location-reminder-server","owner":"pavelpark","html_url":"https://github.com/pavelpark/location-reminder-server","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Parse server for location reminders app","topics":[],"score":1882,"global_rank":384104},{"name":"pavelpark/LocationReminders","owner":"pavelpark","html_url":"https://github.com/pavelpark/LocationReminders","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"As a Developer, I want to implement a mapView into my application, to allow the user a way to visualize different locations they would like to set reminders at in the future.","topics":[],"score":1882,"global_rank":384105},{"name":"pavelpark/Core-Data-Hotel","owner":"pavelpark","html_url":"https://github.com/pavelpark/Core-Data-Hotel","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Objective-C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1882,"global_rank":384106},{"name":"hellovai/mytestproject","owner":"hellovai","html_url":"https://github.com/hellovai/mytestproject","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"testing with AWS","topics":[],"score":1882,"global_rank":384107},{"name":"UW-IUGA/terraria-docker","owner":"UW-IUGA","html_url":"https://github.com/UW-IUGA/terraria-docker","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":1882,"global_rank":384108},{"name":"matthew-russo/LootGenerator","owner":"matthew-russo","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-russo/LootGenerator","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"Borderlands-inspired Loot Generator focusing on modular items","topics":[],"score":1882,"global_rank":384112},{"name":"matthew-russo/TerrainGenerator","owner":"matthew-russo","html_url":"https://github.com/matthew-russo/TerrainGenerator","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"Unity-based Terrain Generator","topics":[],"score":1882,"global_rank":384113}]
