The goal was to create a tool that would help inform people's decisions on what hospital to go to based on why they needed to go to the hospital and how far they were able to travel. We used various measures of hospital performance to recommend to users what hospital to go to, changing which ones were used depending on why the user input they were going to a hospital.  You can access the code and wiki pages for the project on Github here.  It was created for the INFO 370 Introduction to Data Science course at the University of Washington by Arihan Jalan, Sarthak Turakhia, Kazunori Kasahara, and Adele Miller.  Disclaimer: Current limitations with this project limit its ability to provide a definitive recommendation to users, so users of it should not rely solely upon our tool when making a decision.
