the IoT Raindrop Detector, is a project under the domain of the OPEnS (Openly Published Environment Sensing) Lab at Oregon State University. Tut-Tut will be able to detect a raindrop of any size, get an idea of the drop's mass from the intensity at which it falls, and detect the frequency of raindrops. After Tut-Tut gathers this data, it will be able to wirelessly transmit the information to a central server and communicate it to other IoT devices around Oregon State University. The detector will periodically wake up to check for rain and will stay awake as long as rain is detected within two minutes. If it does not detect raindrops within two minutes, it will go back to sleep.","topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"cldougherty/UnityNetCdfReader","owner":"cldougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/cldougherty/UnityNetCdfReader","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"This tool reads scientific data such as Carbon Emissions and Global Temperature from NetCDF/HDF5 files and generates a map as a texture from it in Unity","topics":["climate-change","hdf","netcdf","unity","vr"],"score":2598},{"name":"Rahmanimassoud/Flex_box_morning","owner":"Rahmanimassoud","html_url":"https://github.com/Rahmanimassoud/Flex_box_morning","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"Rahmanimassoud/Grid_flexbox","owner":"Rahmanimassoud","html_url":"https://github.com/Rahmanimassoud/Grid_flexbox","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"brepowell/ML-Contest-Series","owner":"brepowell","html_url":"https://github.com/brepowell/ML-Contest-Series","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Files for the series that I am hosting for UW Bothell ACM in 2024","topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"btahir/Twitter-Pulse-Checker","owner":"btahir","html_url":"https://github.com/btahir/Twitter-Pulse-Checker","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"A quick and dirty way to get a sense of what's trending on Twitter related to a particular Topic.","topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"abhaymittal/Basic-three-address-code-generator","owner":"abhaymittal","html_url":"https://github.com/abhaymittal/Basic-three-address-code-generator","stars":1,"forks":5,"issues":0,"language":"Yacc","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"kakearney/offsetaxis-pkg","owner":"kakearney","html_url":"https://github.com/kakearney/offsetaxis-pkg","stars":1,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"MATLAB","description":"OFFSETAXIS Add an x- or y-axis offset from the plotted axis area","topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"morriscasey/super-duper-octo-adventure","owner":"morriscasey","html_url":"https://github.com/morriscasey/super-duper-octo-adventure","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"kevinbolger/mc-aws-server","owner":"kevinbolger","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinbolger/mc-aws-server","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"akankshasharmadid/Image-Caption-Generator","owner":"akankshasharmadid","html_url":"https://github.com/akankshasharmadid/Image-Caption-Generator","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"In this project, We will try to make the data science application which will generate the captions","topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"hanksnowdon/OptimizationProject","owner":"hanksnowdon","html_url":"https://github.com/hanksnowdon/OptimizationProject","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Optimization Final Project","topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"olegian/CSE447-Final-Project","owner":"olegian","html_url":"https://github.com/olegian/CSE447-Final-Project","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"sam-lundy/Cars-R-Us","owner":"sam-lundy","html_url":"https://github.com/sam-lundy/Cars-R-Us","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"lana-20/mobile-AUTs","owner":"lana-20","html_url":"https://github.com/lana-20/mobile-AUTs","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f5 Mobile Apps for #Testing\ud83d\udcf1 ","topics":["android-app","appium","appium-android","appium-ios","ios-app","mobile","mobile-app","mobile-first","qualityassurance","sdet","sqa","testers","testing"],"score":2598},{"name":"opalkmm/MatchMaker","owner":"opalkmm","html_url":"https://github.com/opalkmm/MatchMaker","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":2,"language":"HTML","description":"this is a dating app, the users are matched based on the quiz results showing their compatibility","topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"mbildstein/ghostwriter","owner":"mbildstein","html_url":"https://github.com/mbildstein/ghostwriter","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"BrasiMexDeveloper/Profile-","owner":"BrasiMexDeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/BrasiMexDeveloper/Profile-","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2598},{"name":"mohummedalee/pii-detection","owner":"mohummedalee","html_url":"https://github.com/mohummedalee/pii-detection","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Code for my submissions to the Kaggle PII detection competition;
