The machine neural-net is not programmed with task-specific rules, rather it gleams how to perform tasks by considering training examples. This specific neural net (above) was trained to determine what contrasting type color was most visible for any random color. It placed its' choice in the \"Guess Text\" section. By doing multiple training sessions of button clicks (white or black) to indicate what was the most visible text, the artificial intelligence quickly mastered how to determine the solution.","score":2192},{"name":"kpekin/Devops","owner":"kpekin","html_url":"https://github.com/kpekin/Devops","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Devops work","score":2192},{"name":"PamelaShaw/FraudRCT","owner":"PamelaShaw","html_url":"https://github.com/PamelaShaw/FraudRCT","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"R","description":"This code supports paper: Detecting Fraudulent Baseline Data in Clinical Trials by Proschan MA And Shaw P.
