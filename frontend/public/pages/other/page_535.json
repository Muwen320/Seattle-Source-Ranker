While the final diagnosis is through biopsy and histopathological examination, the first symptoms are usually visual. Our project looks into the analysis of dermatoscopic images through the implementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms to consolidate a classification model that detects and distinguishes between different categories of skin cancer. Through the optimization of models and approaches pertaining to skin cancer dermatoscopy, we aim to improve the efficacy of computer-assisted cancer for early diagnosis and treatment for patients of skin cancer.","topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"councit/DomPlayGround","owner":"councit","html_url":"https://github.com/councit/DomPlayGround","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"DanZosh/DanZosh_Portfoliosh_Update_II","owner":"DanZosh","html_url":"https://github.com/DanZosh/DanZosh_Portfoliosh_Update_II","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":"Homework 16","topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"brendandburns/rabbitmq-arc","owner":"brendandburns","html_url":"https://github.com/brendandburns/rabbitmq-arc","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"RabbitMQ Configuration for Azure Arc","topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"ryanvickr/Taillight-Control-Unit","owner":"ryanvickr","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanvickr/Taillight-Control-Unit","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"VHDL","description":"An automobile taillight control unit I created using VHDL, programmed to run on the Altera Cyclone V board.","topics":["altera","control-unit","cyclone-v","taillight","vhdl"],"score":2508},{"name":"ryanvickr/Image-Processing","owner":"ryanvickr","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanvickr/Image-Processing","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"MATLAB","description":"Various image processing functions/techniques using MATLAB.","topics":["computer-vision","image","matlab","processing"],"score":2508},{"name":"ryanvickr/MATLAB_Intro","owner":"ryanvickr","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanvickr/MATLAB_Intro","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"MATLAB","description":"A MATLAB script I created explaining and showing the basics of MATLAB.","topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"jz-feng/pumpkin-boy","owner":"jz-feng","html_url":"https://github.com/jz-feng/pumpkin-boy","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"spooky","topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"gamemachine/Granite","owner":"gamemachine","html_url":"https://github.com/gamemachine/Granite","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":".Net TCP server","topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"temilaj/bu-webpage","owner":"temilaj","html_url":"https://github.com/temilaj/bu-webpage","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"ExtraHop/extrahop-devrepo","owner":"ExtraHop","html_url":"https://github.com/ExtraHop/extrahop-devrepo","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"udvale/udvale","owner":"udvale","html_url":"https://github.com/udvale/udvale","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"mmarvick/personal-site","owner":"mmarvick","html_url":"https://github.com/mmarvick/personal-site","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"HTML","description":"My simple website: http://michaelmarvick.com","topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"Grant094/grant094-portfolio","owner":"Grant094","html_url":"https://github.com/Grant094/grant094-portfolio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"A portfolio website for my work","topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"Ada-Developers-Academy/edteam-onboarding","owner":"Ada-Developers-Academy","html_url":"https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/edteam-onboarding","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"raksha78/bash-step","owner":"raksha78","html_url":"https://github.com/raksha78/bash-step","stars":0,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"dsiah/csc4700-project","owner":"dsiah","html_url":"https://github.com/dsiah/csc4700-project","stars":0,"forks":20,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2508},{"name":"daesy13/midterm-project-401","owner":"daesy13","html_url":"https://github.com/daesy13/midterm-project-401","stars":0,"forks":4,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2508}]
