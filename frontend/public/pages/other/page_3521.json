Law predicts movement-time as a function of distance (to the center of the target) and required accuracy (the size of the target). It can be described using the following formula.  MT = a + b \u00d7 ID;  ID = log2(2A/W)  Where MT is task completion time, ID is the index of difficulty, A (amplitude) is the distance to the center of the target and W (width) is the width of the (square) target. This program will help us to collect data so that we can calculate the coefficients a and b in the future.  ","topics":[],"score":1847}]
