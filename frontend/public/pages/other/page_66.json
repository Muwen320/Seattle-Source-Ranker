Student teams will work to develop a desktop application for the streamlining of generative graphics creation -- essentially a User Interface tool that will be used to extend an extant Unity project which currently uses a Microsoft Kinect sensor to track actor movements on stage and generate graphics to augment the scene or actually create entirely new interactive environments. A primary goal for this novel software tool is that it allows for the quick alteration of perimeters in generative algorithms, enabling theatrical scenic designers to edit and design in real time during rehearsal, thus creating the conditions for a more fully integrated and collaborative design process with the director, actors, and other designers.
