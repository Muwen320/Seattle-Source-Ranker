While the final diagnosis is through biopsy and histopathological examination, the first symptoms are usually visual. Our project looks into the analysis of dermatoscopic images through the implementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms to consolidate a classification model that detects and distinguishes between different categories of skin cancer. Through the optimization of models and approaches pertaining to skin cancer dermatoscopy, we aim to improve the efficacy of computer-assisted cancer for early diagnosis and treatment for patients of skin cancer.","topics":[],"score":2005.6000000000001,"global_rank":309677},{"name":"brae-pete/CE_Hardware","owner":"brae-pete","html_url":"https://github.com/brae-pete/CE_Hardware","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2005.6000000000001,"global_rank":309678},{"name":"kaniini/aiohttpsigs","owner":"kaniini","html_url":"https://github.com/kaniini/aiohttpsigs","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"HTTP Signatures for aiohttp.web applications","topics":[],"score":2005.6000000000001,"global_rank":309679},{"name":"nullset2/gittest","owner":"nullset2","html_url":"https://github.com/nullset2/gittest","stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"test","topics":[],"score":2005.6000000000001,"global_rank":309680}]
