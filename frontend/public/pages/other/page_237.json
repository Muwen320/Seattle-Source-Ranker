The notebook presents a face recognition system. Tthe ideas presented here are from FaceNetand DeepFace.  Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories:  Face Verification - \"is this the claimed person?\". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. Face Recognition - \"who is this person?\". For example, the video lecture showed a face recognition video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem.","score":2919},{"name":"margaretmz/CVND-Landmark-Detection-Tracking-SLAM","owner":"margaretmz","html_url":"https://github.com/margaretmz/CVND-Landmark-Detection-Tracking-SLAM","stars":3,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Landmark detection and robot tracking with SLAM","score":2919},{"name":"jacob-ebey/hyperscript-snippets","owner":"jacob-ebey","html_url":"https://github.com/jacob-ebey/hyperscript-snippets","stars":3,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"A collection of _hyperscript snippets","score":2919},{"name":"somros/ROMS_to_Ecopath","owner":"somros","html_url":"https://github.com/somros/ROMS_to_Ecopath","stars":2,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Code to translate ROMS output to Ecopath physical and biogeochemical forcings","score":2919},{"name":"FredHutch/sciCnT_manuscript_2023","owner":"FredHutch","html_url":"https://github.com/FredHutch/sciCnT_manuscript_2023","stars":2,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Analysis code and files associated with the sciCnT manuscript","score":2919},{"name":"reskillamericans/Wildfire-Group3-flutter","owner":"reskillamericans","html_url":"https://github.com/reskillamericans/Wildfire-Group3-flutter","stars":2,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"Dart","description":null,"score":2919},{"name":"jazonshou/jazonshou","owner":"jazonshou","html_url":"https://github.com/jazonshou/jazonshou","stars":1,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Welcome to funland!","score":2919},{"name":"laurahspencer/pcod-juveniles-2023","owner":"laurahspencer","html_url":"https://github.com/laurahspencer/pcod-juveniles-2023","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2919},{"name":"brandiw/javascript-quiz","owner":"brandiw","html_url":"https://github.com/brandiw/javascript-quiz","stars":1,"forks":74,"issues":22,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2919},{"name":"theawless/Brotato-TimeControl","owner":"theawless","html_url":"https://github.com/theawless/Brotato-TimeControl","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"GDScript","description":"Control time to get to the real fun","score":2919},{"name":"Courtskit/virtual-traveler","owner":"Courtskit","html_url":"https://github.com/Courtskit/virtual-traveler","stars":1,"forks":3,"issues":3,"language":"EJS","description":null,"score":2919},{"name":"codefellows/seattle-python-401d18","owner":"codefellows","html_url":"https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-python-401d18","stars":1,"forks":5,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Course Repository","score":2919},{"name":"SanderGi/DesignBuildFly","owner":"SanderGi","html_url":"https://github.com/SanderGi/DesignBuildFly","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Useful tools made for Design Build Fly at UW.
