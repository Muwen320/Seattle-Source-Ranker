Technologies used are NLTK, Python, Whoosh, Django and CMU Ark Tweet Parser. The fast information sharing on Twitter from millions of users all over the world leads to almost real-time reporting of events. It is extremely important for business and administrative decision makers to learn events popularity as quickly as possible, as it can buy extra precious time for them to make informed decisions. Therefore, we introduce the problem of predicting future popularity trend of events on microblogging platforms. Traditionally, trend prediction has been performed by using time series analysis of past popularity to forecast the future popularity changes.","score":2985},{"name":"hbthen3rd/unieye-vscode","owner":"hbthen3rd","html_url":"https://github.com/hbthen3rd/unieye-vscode","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"A vintage, retro, dark, vibrant, contrast, indigo Visual Studio Code theme","score":2985},{"name":"heathkit/kinect-oculus-demo","owner":"heathkit","html_url":"https://github.com/heathkit/kinect-oculus-demo","stars":5,"forks":5,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"Simple unity project integrating Kiniect data with Zigfu and the Oculus SDK","score":2985},{"name":"tgeng/dotty-parser-combinators","owner":"tgeng","html_url":"https://github.com/tgeng/dotty-parser-combinators","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Scala","description":"A simple parser combinator library for dotty (Scala 3)","score":2985},{"name":"TiesdeKok/mnsc.2023.4670","owner":"TiesdeKok","html_url":"https://github.com/TiesdeKok/mnsc.2023.4670","stars":4,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Code repository for \"How Resilient Are Firms\u2019 Financial Reporting Processes?\"","score":2985},{"name":"kdr/avc","owner":"kdr","html_url":"https://github.com/kdr/avc","stars":3,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2985},{"name":"aenyeart/Portfolio-Website","owner":"aenyeart","html_url":"https://github.com/aenyeart/Portfolio-Website","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Repo for my portfolio website using HTML and CSS","score":2985},{"name":"justinvp/templates-aws","owner":"justinvp","html_url":"https://github.com/justinvp/templates-aws","stars":2,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":null,"score":2985},{"name":"7j7j/data-sci-learning","owner":"7j7j","html_url":"https://github.com/7j7j/data-sci-learning","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Repo of various resources and links for anyone","score":2985},{"name":"glstream/sf_app","owner":"glstream","html_url":"https://github.com/glstream/sf_app","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Vue","description":null,"score":2985},{"name":"KevinXuxuxu/blog","owner":"KevinXuxuxu","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinXuxuxu/blog","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":"static personal website generator built from spectre.css, mistune + pygments etc.","score":2985},{"name":"circa10a/circa10a","owner":"circa10a","html_url":"https://github.com/circa10a/circa10a","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"My profile readme","score":2985},{"name":"akashkumar916/akashkumar916","owner":"akashkumar916","html_url":"https://github.com/akashkumar916/akashkumar916","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"score":2985},{"name":"sendhil/mac-laptop-setup","owner":"sendhil","html_url":"https://github.com/sendhil/mac-laptop-setup","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":null,"score":2985},{"name":"rynhndrcksn/rynhndrcksn","owner":"rynhndrcksn","html_url":"https://github.com/rynhndrcksn/rynhndrcksn","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"My personal readme","score":2985},{"name":"redgeoff/node-vagrant","owner":"redgeoff","html_url":"https://github.com/redgeoff/node-vagrant","stars":7,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":"Spin up a VM running nodejs","score":2984},{"name":"praeclarum/rt","owner":"praeclarum","html_url":"https://github.com/praeclarum/rt","stars":6,"forks":5,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"My Pet Raytracer in C#","score":2984},{"name":"rjayatilleka/vim-insert-char","owner":"rjayatilleka","html_url":"https://github.com/rjayatilleka/vim-insert-char","stars":5,"forks":3,"issues":1,"language":"VimL","description":"Insert count of a character","score":2984},{"name":"hpsin/ClaimsChallengesForResources","owner":"hpsin","html_url":"https://github.com/hpsin/ClaimsChallengesForResources","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Draft proposal to support passing claims challenges from an RS to an AS via the client.
