C# weather application is designed so that users can input a city that they would like to check weather details on. The weather data for this program is retrieved by utilizing a free RESTful API service found on openweathermap.org As a result of the query sent to the API with a specific city name and an app_id, a JSON file is returned containing the weather details on the chosen city. To make sense of the data, de-serialization is made to turn the contents of the JSON file to meaningful C# objects. After deserializing the JSON file, useful weather information is gathered by calling the states in of RootObject. Then, the weather details get printed via using the console.","topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"ianmah/ian-jekyll","owner":"ianmah","html_url":"https://github.com/ianmah/ian-jekyll","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Personal website built with Jekyll","topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"kirbycope/telerik-rest","owner":"kirbycope","html_url":"https://github.com/kirbycope/telerik-rest","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Testing REST API Using Test Studio","topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"Heidijvr/group-project-2","owner":"Heidijvr","html_url":"https://github.com/Heidijvr/group-project-2","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"Dhruvilbhatt/Practicegit_tut","owner":"Dhruvilbhatt","html_url":"https://github.com/Dhruvilbhatt/Practicegit_tut","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"TerminalWitchcraft/CV-HW","owner":"TerminalWitchcraft","html_url":"https://github.com/TerminalWitchcraft/CV-HW","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"knheidorn/week-1-day-5-discussion-seattle-web-career-021819","owner":"knheidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/knheidorn/week-1-day-5-discussion-seattle-web-career-021819","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"polashrp/flutter_drawer","owner":"polashrp","html_url":"https://github.com/polashrp/flutter_drawer","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Dart","description":"Flutter app with drawer navigation sidbar","topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"polashrp/flutter_basic","owner":"polashrp","html_url":"https://github.com/polashrp/flutter_basic","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Dart","description":"Start Flutter App","topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"wobscale/status.wobscale.website","owner":"wobscale","html_url":"https://github.com/wobscale/status.wobscale.website","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"SCSS","description":"Wobscale System Status webbersite","topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"sdrafahl/getListOfPrimeNumbers","owner":"sdrafahl","html_url":"https://github.com/sdrafahl/getListOfPrimeNumbers","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"XSLT","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"SivanMehta/battery-notify","owner":"SivanMehta","html_url":"https://github.com/SivanMehta/battery-notify","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":"A small script that tells when the battery on a Mac has reached a certain point.","topics":["battery","macos","push-notifications","shell-script"],"score":2112},{"name":"kerstentw/trade_api","owner":"kerstentw","html_url":"https://github.com/kerstentw/trade_api","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"aarya-ci/Prolog-Assignment","owner":"aarya-ci","html_url":"https://github.com/aarya-ci/Prolog-Assignment","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Prolog","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"foolscapcon/org.foolscap.podcast","owner":"foolscapcon","html_url":"https://github.com/foolscapcon/org.foolscap.podcast","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"hugo podcast based on castanet","topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"jetsgit/smartwaiverapi","owner":"jetsgit","html_url":"https://github.com/jetsgit/smartwaiverapi","stars":0,"forks":4,"issues":0,"language":"ASP","description":"Example code for using Smartwaiver.com's API","topics":[],"score":2112},{"name":"matsengrp/gcreplay-viz","owner":"matsengrp","html_url":"https://github.com/matsengrp/gcreplay-viz","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2112}]
