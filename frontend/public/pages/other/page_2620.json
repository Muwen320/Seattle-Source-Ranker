C# weather application is designed so that users can input a city that they would like to check weather details on. The weather data for this program is retrieved by utilizing a free RESTful API service found on openweathermap.org As a result of the query sent to the API with a specific city name and an app_id, a JSON file is returned containing the weather details on the chosen city. To make sense of the data, de-serialization is made to turn the contents of the JSON file to meaningful C# objects. After deserializing the JSON file, useful weather information is gathered by calling the states in of RootObject.
