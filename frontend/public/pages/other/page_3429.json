Numerical descriptors of the molecule's chemical structure are used as features for the prediction. The data came from an old Kaggle competition. The predictions obtained here are comparable to the top finishers in the original competition. Test data used to evaluate this model, however, is not the same as the one used in the original competition. Additionally, in the original competition models were trained and tested on over 15 different molecular activities. The model here is trained and tested on only one molecular activity. But, the method used here is generally applicable to other molecular activities too.","score":1892},{"name":"KatieK2/0-to-nodebots-links-2017","owner":"KatieK2","html_url":"https://github.com/KatieK2/0-to-nodebots-links-2017","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"2017 list of links from \"0 to Nodebots\" presentations.
