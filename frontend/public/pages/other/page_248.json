Httrack was taking way too much CPU time in the GUI mode, didn't provide good enough feedback in the console mode, and didn't provide enough control overall. So I wrote a web crawler backend and a console frontend for it. It can be used much more easily than httrack. It has a number of features that httrack doesn't, such as rewriting URLs and page content on the fly with regular expressions or arbitrary processing code, which enables a few interesting and important scenarios. I use it to mirror sites for offline reading, mainly so that I can ensure that I still have a copy even if the site gets taken down. Maybe httrack has improved since I wrote this.
