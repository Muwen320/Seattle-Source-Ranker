The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.  In this project, you will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of ASL letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, you will train the network and test its performance.","topics":[],"score":2178,"global_rank":225092},{"name":"Teddyyo19/Hottest-Topic-in-Machine-Learning","owner":"Teddyyo19","html_url":"https://github.com/Teddyyo19/Hottest-Topic-in-Machine-Learning","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter
