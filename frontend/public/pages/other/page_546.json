I spend a lot of time really learning and understanding the fundamentals of what was going on within the code and how everything fits precisely together to make a beautiful website that can be used in the real world. I enjoy this design creating a large \"hero\" image with a banner. Unlike my portfolio site where JS was implemented for the fixed navbar at a certain point when scrolling down, this site just has a static navbar with a smaller height that stays on throughout scroll. I think learning how to do the same thing several differnent ways really instills the fundamentals of front end HTML and CSS skills.","topics":[],"score":2503},{"name":"master-hax/compose-openvpn-ipfs","owner":"master-hax","html_url":"https://github.com/master-hax/compose-openvpn-ipfs","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"a multi-container application to run an IPFS node behind an OpenVPN client","topics":["compose","docker","docker-compose","download","ipfs","ipfs-api","ipfs-gateway","ipfs-node","openvpn","openvpn-client","port-forwarding","vpn"],"score":2503},{"name":"kzys/dockerfile-quine","owner":"kzys","html_url":"https://github.com/kzys/dockerfile-quine","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Dockerfile","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2503},{"name":"hockeymonday/cv-site","owner":"hockeymonday","html_url":"https://github.com/hockeymonday/cv-site","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"My CV website.","topics":[],"score":2503},{"name":"Purefekt/Chat-application","owner":"Purefekt","html_url":"https://github.com/Purefekt/Chat-application","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"\ud83d\udcac A WPF chat application with MySQL database.
