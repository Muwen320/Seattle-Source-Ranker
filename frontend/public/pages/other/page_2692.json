This means I can add the torrent file to a specified folder location on my Plug computer (I ssh into it from any location) and my Pogoplug, which has the transmission daemon running on it will enqueue the torrent file and start the download onto one of the attached drives. When you have transmission running on a network attached computer, you can access the transmission URL only from the network, the computer is on. With this setting you can however get transmission to do the work for you, from another network.","topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302739},{"name":"adelbertc/nets-scala","owner":"adelbertc","html_url":"https://github.com/adelbertc/nets-scala","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Scala","description":"Simple graph (graph theory-graph.. not charts/plots) library for Scala.","topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302740},{"name":"sukharevd/hadoop-install","owner":"sukharevd","html_url":"https://github.com/sukharevd/hadoop-install","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":"Scripts for automatic installation of Apache Hadoop for cases when hosts are beyond different NATs.","topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302742},{"name":"apsc/duckdb_demo","owner":"apsc","html_url":"https://github.com/apsc/duckdb_demo","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Duck DB Demo for IMT 570 class","topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302744},{"name":"Asterika/dream_fuel_designs","owner":"Asterika","html_url":"https://github.com/Asterika/dream_fuel_designs","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302751},{"name":"jnicholas/chess","owner":"jnicholas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicholas/chess","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302754},{"name":"bandrews/wordsdotninja","owner":"bandrews","html_url":"https://github.com/bandrews/wordsdotninja","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302757},{"name":"katrinasilver/gsnacks-frontend","owner":"katrinasilver","html_url":"https://github.com/katrinasilver/gsnacks-frontend","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":"Galvanize Snacks front-end http://gsnacks.surge.sh","topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302759},{"name":"jfullerton44/kickstarter","owner":"jfullerton44","html_url":"https://github.com/jfullerton44/kickstarter","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302763},{"name":"amkhokar/react-hooks-keglist","owner":"amkhokar","html_url":"https://github.com/amkhokar/react-hooks-keglist","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302764},{"name":"deyim/ATR_TMP","owner":"deyim","html_url":"https://github.com/deyim/ATR_TMP","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302766},{"name":"RobinRobinG/LostInTheWoods","owner":"RobinRobinG","html_url":"https://github.com/RobinRobinG/LostInTheWoods","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"C# MVC Dapper ","topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302767},{"name":"RobinRobinG/QuotingDojo_MVC","owner":"RobinRobinG","html_url":"https://github.com/RobinRobinG/QuotingDojo_MVC","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302768},{"name":"RobinRobinG/FormValidation","owner":"RobinRobinG","html_url":"https://github.com/RobinRobinG/FormValidation","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"c# Form with validation stuff","topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302769},{"name":"RobinRobinG/DojoSurvey","owner":"RobinRobinG","html_url":"https://github.com/RobinRobinG/DojoSurvey","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"c# Form","topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302770},{"name":"RobinRobinG/DojoPortfolio","owner":"RobinRobinG","html_url":"https://github.com/RobinRobinG/DojoPortfolio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"c# routing","topics":[],"score":2100,"global_rank":302771},{"name":"RobinRobinG/BlackJack","owner":"RobinRobinG","html_url":"https://github.com/RobinRobinG/BlackJack","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"C# Blank Jack Console Game!
