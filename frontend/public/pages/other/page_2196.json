Your firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, your firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.  The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. You\u2019re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm\u2019s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, you\u2019ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.","score":2169},{"name":"WillDittig/Fintech-Challange-Module-5","owner":"WillDittig","html_url":"https://github.com/WillDittig/Fintech-Challange-Module-5","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"You\u2019ve decided to start a fintech consulting firm that focuses on projects to benefit local communities. You just won your first contract with a large credit union. The project entails building a tool to help credit union members evaluate their financial health. Specifically, the credit union board wants the members to be able to do two things. First, they should be able to assess their monthly budgets. Second, they should be able to forecast a reasonably effective retirement plan based on their current holdings of cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds. The chief technology officer (CTO) of the credit union wants you to develop a prototype application to present at its next assembly.","score":2169},{"name":"jonfleming/AudioAnalyzer","owner":"jonfleming","html_url":"https://github.com/jonfleming/AudioAnalyzer","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"segwuonwu/Flask-Todo-App","owner":"segwuonwu","html_url":"https://github.com/segwuonwu/Flask-Todo-App","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"segwuonwu/Flask-SEI29","owner":"segwuonwu","html_url":"https://github.com/segwuonwu/Flask-SEI29","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"Tuzosdaniel12/branches-demo","owner":"Tuzosdaniel12","html_url":"https://github.com/Tuzosdaniel12/branches-demo","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":4,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"samuelsholib/codeRefactor","owner":"samuelsholib","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelsholib/codeRefactor","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"samuelsholib/sds-portfolio","owner":"samuelsholib","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelsholib/sds-portfolio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"jroyalty07/STUFF","owner":"jroyalty07","html_url":"https://github.com/jroyalty07/STUFF","stars":0,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"Korrigan36/VisaAutomationCode","owner":"Korrigan36","html_url":"https://github.com/Korrigan36/VisaAutomationCode","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"This code is a further development of my VISA instrument automation code","score":2169},{"name":"arieldeardorff/2021-10-18-ttt-online-EDT","owner":"arieldeardorff","html_url":"https://github.com/arieldeardorff/2021-10-18-ttt-online-EDT","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Website for Instructor Training course: https://arieldeardorff.github.io/2021-10-18-ttt-online-EDT/","score":2169},{"name":"leeroywking/git-ho-api","owner":"leeroywking","html_url":"https://github.com/leeroywking/git-ho-api","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"excircle/learn-consul","owner":"excircle","html_url":"https://github.com/excircle/learn-consul","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"A repository dedicated to learning consul","score":2169},{"name":"attilah/test-repo","owner":"attilah","html_url":"https://github.com/attilah/test-repo","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"nocsi/nguyen.love","owner":"nocsi","html_url":"https://github.com/nocsi/nguyen.love","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"KarnVadaliya/rockstar-webapi","owner":"KarnVadaliya","html_url":"https://github.com/KarnVadaliya/rockstar-webapi","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"KarnVadaliya/rockstar-webappmvc","owner":"KarnVadaliya","html_url":"https://github.com/KarnVadaliya/rockstar-webappmvc","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"kmayerb/dvamp","owner":"kmayerb","html_url":"https://github.com/kmayerb/dvamp","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Dockerfile","description":"docker container for use with vampire (AWS batch ready)","score":2169},{"name":"rkgallaway/learning-journal-102n49","owner":"rkgallaway","html_url":"https://github.com/rkgallaway/learning-journal-102n49","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"this is my learning journal","score":2169},{"name":"JoshTDesign/PasswordManager","owner":"JoshTDesign","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshTDesign/PasswordManager","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"ethanis/issue-forms-scratch","owner":"ethanis","html_url":"https://github.com/ethanis/issue-forms-scratch","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2169},{"name":"jiwonhan1/Park.Solution","owner":"jiwonhan1","html_url":"https://github.com/jiwonhan1/Park.Solution","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"API fetching -
