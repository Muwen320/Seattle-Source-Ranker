sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. In this contest, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. This Kaggle Getting Started Competition provides an ideal starting place for people who may not have a lot of experience in data science and machine learning.\"","topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"davidbmar/youtube_transcriber_3","owner":"davidbmar","html_url":"https://github.com/davidbmar/youtube_transcriber_3","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"canaantt/cron-cleaner","owner":"canaantt","html_url":"https://github.com/canaantt/cron-cleaner","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"a cronjob service to clean s3 buckets according to the github activity","topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"drkrieger1/bucket","owner":"drkrieger1","html_url":"https://github.com/drkrieger1/bucket","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"NaamaBarIlan/setup_demo","owner":"NaamaBarIlan","html_url":"https://github.com/NaamaBarIlan/setup_demo","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":"Repo to demo the setup process for 201d48","topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"NaamaBarIlan/demo-4-30","owner":"NaamaBarIlan","html_url":"https://github.com/NaamaBarIlan/demo-4-30","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Demo for 201d48 on 30 April","topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"joperezr/SmartHomePi","owner":"joperezr","html_url":"https://github.com/joperezr/SmartHomePi","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"This Repo contains the Smart Home Raspberry Pi application for the Build Demo.","topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"bvasilop/Create-React-SPA-Practice","owner":"bvasilop","html_url":"https://github.com/bvasilop/Create-React-SPA-Practice","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"bvasilop/React-SPA-Practice-App","owner":"bvasilop","html_url":"https://github.com/bvasilop/React-SPA-Practice-App","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":"A practice app for a react spa","topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"GoldBeardSea/portfolio","owner":"GoldBeardSea","html_url":"https://github.com/GoldBeardSea/portfolio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"nathan-m-schneider-22/may1","owner":"nathan-m-schneider-22","html_url":"https://github.com/nathan-m-schneider-22/may1","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"ipkeisam/advdev_homework_template","owner":"ipkeisam","html_url":"https://github.com/ipkeisam/advdev_homework_template","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"ipkeisam/advdev_homework_template-","owner":"ipkeisam","html_url":"https://github.com/ipkeisam/advdev_homework_template-","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"armankhondker/EE-316-Digital-Logic-Design","owner":"armankhondker","html_url":"https://github.com/armankhondker/EE-316-Digital-Logic-Design","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Code for EE 316 Digital Logic Design ","topics":[],"score":2122},{"name":"rithvik-duddupudi/COVPred","owner":"rithvik-duddupudi","html_url":"https://github.com/rithvik-duddupudi/COVPred","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"COVID-19 RNA Sequence Predictions (LSTM and Transformer-based models)","topics":[],"score":2122}]
