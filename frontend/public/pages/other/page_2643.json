On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. In this contest, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. This Kaggle Getting Started Competition provides an ideal starting place for people who may not have a lot of experience in data science and machine learning.\"","score":2123},{"name":"jessica1438/Team_Analyzer_Edrevel","owner":"jessica1438","html_url":"https://github.com/jessica1438/Team_Analyzer_Edrevel","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2123},{"name":"shirhatti/diagnostics-demo","owner":"shirhatti","html_url":"https://github.com/shirhatti/diagnostics-demo","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2123},{"name":"shirhatti/cautious-enigma","owner":"shirhatti","html_url":"https://github.com/shirhatti/cautious-enigma","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":null,"score":2123},{"name":"thomasmchen/sprawl-dev","owner":"thomasmchen","html_url":"https://github.com/thomasmchen/sprawl-dev","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Dev deployment of sprawl client","score":2123},{"name":"polangs/demo-4-30","owner":"polangs","html_url":"https://github.com/polangs/demo-4-30","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Demo for 201d48 on 30 April","score":2123},{"name":"SkateCodeN/TripleByte_Simple_Question","owner":"SkateCodeN","html_url":"https://github.com/SkateCodeN/TripleByte_Simple_Question","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"The name does the description justice","score":2123},{"name":"SkateCodeN/C-and-HTML","owner":"SkateCodeN","html_url":"https://github.com/SkateCodeN/C-and-HTML","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"Using C# we create a program that reads from a dtc code file and creates a webpage out of it ","score":2123},{"name":"GoldBeardSea/portfolio","owner":"GoldBeardSea","html_url":"https://github.com/GoldBeardSea/portfolio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"score":2123},{"name":"Skymore/Skymore","owner":"Skymore","html_url":"https://github.com/Skymore/Skymore","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"\ud83d\udc4b GitHub Profile README for Rui Tao","score":2123},{"name":"pmallari/VideoGameAnalysis","owner":"pmallari","html_url":"https://github.com/pmallari/VideoGameAnalysis","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"Analysis of Video Game Sales data found here: https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales","score":2123},{"name":"sherpalhakpa/public_html","owner":"sherpalhakpa","html_url":"https://github.com/sherpalhakpa/public_html","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"First HTML/CSS/JS Project","score":2123},{"name":"BotScutters/predicting-flight-cancellations","owner":"BotScutters","html_url":"https://github.com/BotScutters/predicting-flight-cancellations","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"This project uses machine learning classification models to predict flight cancellations based on historical data","score":2123},{"name":"psturmfels/CongressionalResignations","owner":"psturmfels","html_url":"https://github.com/psturmfels/CongressionalResignations","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"An INTERACTIVE plot of congressional resignations over time.
