Only train dataset consists a label of number of people Survived as this label is used to train the neural network.Submission format is a .CSV file which contains two main aspects of dataset i.e. PassengerId and Survived which give values of number of people survived. Results of this project is converted into a .csv format which is provided in the zip folder with the code and then it is compared with Kaggle results so the accuracy what we get over here might slightly vary from the accuracy we achieve in Kaggle submission. Totally 3 diverse types of neural network operations are tried on this dataset i.e. 1) Single Hidden MLP 2) RNN 3) DNN each Neural Net is processed in different ipynb files before combining it. DNN is my baseline model because I achieved my maximum accuracy of 88.53% while processing data with it and rank achieved in it is 1335 out of 9,803.","topics":[],"score":2611},{"name":"RFessehai/Weather","owner":"RFessehai","html_url":"https://github.com/RFessehai/Weather","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2611},{"name":"prismofeverything/orb","owner":"prismofeverything","html_url":"https://github.com/prismofeverything/orb","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Clojure","description":"Floating orb soundscape generative light responding entity","topics":[],"score":2611},{"name":"TobinCavanaugh/NeoSlide","owner":"TobinCavanaugh","html_url":"https://github.com/TobinCavanaugh/NeoSlide","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"A wave based first person shooter, made in one hour as a personal challenge","topics":["challenge","fps","game","movement-shooter","unity","unity-3d"],"score":2611},{"name":"practicusai/practicusai","owner":"practicusai","html_url":"https://github.com/practicusai/practicusai","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Practicus AI is an end-to-end Data Science platform, which works like a spreadsheet.","topics":[],"score":2611},{"name":"dudleycarr/nsq-docker-compose","owner":"dudleycarr","html_url":"https://github.com/dudleycarr/nsq-docker-compose","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Example docker compose configurations for running NSQ services","topics":[],"score":2611},{"name":"justschen/the-nothing-extension","owner":"justschen","html_url":"https://github.com/justschen/the-nothing-extension","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"A barebones extension (courtesy of Michael) for testing purposes.","topics":[],"score":2611},{"name":"devlance/googledevdocs.github.io","owner":"devlance","html_url":"https://github.com/devlance/googledevdocs.github.io","stars":1,"forks":9,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":"Documentation source","topics":[],"score":2611},{"name":"mcinglis/aoc2023-clojure","owner":"mcinglis","html_url":"https://github.com/mcinglis/aoc2023-clojure","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Clojure","description":"Advent of Code 2023 solutions in Clojure.","topics":[],"score":2611},{"name":"jbloom/Huanan_market_samples_addtl_analysis","owner":"jbloom","html_url":"https://github.com/jbloom/Huanan_market_samples_addtl_analysis","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"HTML","description":"additional analysis of metagenomic samples from the Huanan Seafood Market","topics":[],"score":2611},{"name":"mdn102/30js-challenge","owner":"mdn102","html_url":"https://github.com/mdn102/30js-challenge","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":4,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2611},{"name":"johncrim/ng16-yarn-pnp","owner":"johncrim","html_url":"https://github.com/johncrim/ng16-yarn-pnp","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Starter project, plus setup steps, for a new Angular project + lib using Yarn PnP.","topics":[],"score":2611},{"name":"JerinGM/Python-Flask-WebServer","owner":"JerinGM","html_url":"https://github.com/JerinGM/Python-Flask-WebServer","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2611},{"name":"hanfei1986/Solve-travelling-salesman-problem-with-genetic-algorithm","owner":"hanfei1986","html_url":"https://github.com/hanfei1986/Solve-travelling-salesman-problem-with-genetic-algorithm","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: \"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?\" In this notebook, I demonstate the solution of this problem with the genetic algorithm.","topics":["genetic-algorithm","travelling-salesman-problem"],"score":2611},{"name":"hanfei1986/Fine-tune-BERT-for-sentiment-analysis","owner":"hanfei1986","html_url":"https://github.com/hanfei1986/Fine-tune-BERT-for-sentiment-analysis","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"BERT is an NLP model developed by Google Research in 2018, after its inception it has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on several NLP tasks.
