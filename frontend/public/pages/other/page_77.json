Setting up a simple WebDAV server to serve some files only requires adding some lines to your web.config file; no code needs to be written. If you want to serve another type of data over WebDAV, it is fairly easy to implement new service providers.","topics":["asp-net","webdav","webdav-server"],"score":3499},{"name":"tunz/chow","owner":"tunz","html_url":"https://github.com/tunz/chow","stars":11,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"Haskell","description":"Static Analysis Checker with Micro Grammar","topics":[],"score":3499},{"name":"armanbilge/oxidized","owner":"armanbilge","html_url":"https://github.com/armanbilge/oxidized","stars":9,"forks":0,"issues":4,"language":"Scala","description":"Effected MTL","topics":[],"score":3499},{"name":"tapizquent/scaled_animated_scaffold","owner":"tapizquent","html_url":"https://github.com/tapizquent/scaled_animated_scaffold","stars":8,"forks":3,"issues":2,"language":"Dart","description":"A Scaffold-like Widget that animates and reveals a menu","topics":[],"score":3499},{"name":"trodemaster/packer-ubuntu","owner":"trodemaster","html_url":"https://github.com/trodemaster/packer-ubuntu","stars":7,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":"Ubuntu 18.04 server packer template.
