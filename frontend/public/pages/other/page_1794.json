The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.  In this project, you will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of ASL letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, you will train the network and test its performance.","topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"ozharb/.Net-Programming-Exercises","owner":"ozharb","html_url":"https://github.com/ozharb/.Net-Programming-Exercises","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"kwehden/UserQuantumBenchmarks","owner":"kwehden","html_url":"https://github.com/kwehden/UserQuantumBenchmarks","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"This is an attempt to provide simple examples of core quantum algorithms that can be run on the widest array of quantum systems (quantum hardware and an atomic unit off classical hardware)","topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"temilaj/NLP-with-tensorflow","owner":"temilaj","html_url":"https://github.com/temilaj/NLP-with-tensorflow","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"manojchaulagain/test-jenkinsx","owner":"manojchaulagain","html_url":"https://github.com/manojchaulagain/test-jenkinsx","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Makefile","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"Rubick1997/flexbox-gallery","owner":"Rubick1997","html_url":"https://github.com/Rubick1997/flexbox-gallery","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"Rubick1997/flexbox-fullpage","owner":"Rubick1997","html_url":"https://github.com/Rubick1997/flexbox-fullpage","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"Rubick1997/flexbox-grid","owner":"Rubick1997","html_url":"https://github.com/Rubick1997/flexbox-grid","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"Rubick1997/flexbox-practice","owner":"Rubick1997","html_url":"https://github.com/Rubick1997/flexbox-practice","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"Rubick1997/float-practice","owner":"Rubick1997","html_url":"https://github.com/Rubick1997/float-practice","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"Rubick1997/redux-counter","owner":"Rubick1997","html_url":"https://github.com/Rubick1997/redux-counter","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"jfullerton44/blank","owner":"jfullerton44","html_url":"https://github.com/jfullerton44/blank","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"just an empty repo","topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"phoitack/Springboard_MEC_3.5.2_Capstone_submission","owner":"phoitack","html_url":"https://github.com/phoitack/Springboard_MEC_3.5.2_Capstone_submission","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"coolkennylee/capstone498_individual","owner":"coolkennylee","html_url":"https://github.com/coolkennylee/capstone498_individual","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"R","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"doctral/electronnetdemo","owner":"doctral","html_url":"https://github.com/doctral/electronnetdemo","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"rgraue/portfolio","owner":"rgraue","html_url":"https://github.com/rgraue/portfolio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"rgraue/final_front_csc3221","owner":"rgraue","html_url":"https://github.com/rgraue/final_front_csc3221","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Front end of final_server_csc3221","topics":[],"score":2180},{"name":"jarrettdev/Youtube-Livechat-Comments","owner":"jarrettdev","html_url":"https://github.com/jarrettdev/Youtube-Livechat-Comments","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Comments from various livestreams on Youtube.
