177RG is an excellent training platform for FAR 61.31(e) complex aircraft: it has a controllable pitch prop, retractable gear, and flaps. Its big, 200HP fuel-injected engine will get you there fast, and it is fully IFR capable.  Sonny Lacey has made a really fantastic 1970 Cardinal 177B. His Cardinal flies wonderfully but, being an earlier variant of the plane, lacks the retractable gear and extra power of the later RG. Sonny graciously granted me permission to deviate from his non-modification license and to base my RG upon his B model. I deeply appreciate this and stress that credit for the foundation airframe and its modeling belong to Sonny; his is really well done.
