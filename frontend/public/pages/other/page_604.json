In the experiment simulated by the data, an advertising promotion was tested to see if it would bring more customers to purchase a specific product priced at $10. Since it costs the company 0.15 to send out each promotion, it would be best to limit that promotion only to those that are most receptive to the promotion. Each data point includes one column indicating whether or not an individual was sent a promotion for the product, and one column indicating whether or not that individual eventually purchased that product. Each individual also has seven additional features associated with them, which are provided abstractly as V1-V7.","topics":[],"score":2469,"global_rank":75007},{"name":"snickerton/Linux-PoisonIvy","owner":"snickerton","html_url":"https://github.com/snickerton/Linux-PoisonIvy","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Shell","description":"shhhh, top secret project in progress","topics":[],"score":2469,"global_rank":75008},{"name":"Shikhas/PythonPracBook","owner":"Shikhas","html_url":"https://github.com/Shikhas/PythonPracBook","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2469,"global_rank":75010}]
