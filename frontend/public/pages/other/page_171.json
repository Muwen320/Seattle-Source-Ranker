The fast information sharing on Twitter from millions of users all over the world leads to almost real-time reporting of events. It is extremely important for business and administrative decision makers to learn events popularity as quickly as possible, as it can buy extra precious time for them to make informed decisions. Therefore, we introduce the problem of predicting future popularity trend of events on microblogging platforms. Traditionally, trend prediction has been performed by using time series analysis of past popularity to forecast the future popularity changes.","topics":[],"score":2984},{"name":"rjayatilleka/vim-insert-char","owner":"rjayatilleka","html_url":"https://github.com/rjayatilleka/vim-insert-char","stars":5,"forks":3,"issues":1,"language":"VimL","description":"Insert count of a character","topics":[],"score":2984},{"name":"JonathanReiss15/awesome-smartpy","owner":"JonathanReiss15","html_url":"https://github.com/JonathanReiss15/awesome-smartpy","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Resources for developing for Tezos with SmartPy","topics":["awesome","awesome-list","python","smartpy","tezos"],"score":2984},{"name":"heathkit/kinect-oculus-demo","owner":"heathkit","html_url":"https://github.com/heathkit/kinect-oculus-demo","stars":5,"forks":5,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":"Simple unity project integrating Kiniect data with Zigfu and the Oculus SDK","topics":[],"score":2984},{"name":"JacopoMangiavacchi/animegan2-coreml","owner":"JacopoMangiavacchi","html_url":"https://github.com/JacopoMangiavacchi/animegan2-coreml","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2984},{"name":"pelikhan/github-agentic-workflows","owner":"pelikhan","html_url":"https://github.com/pelikhan/github-agentic-workflows","stars":4,"forks":1,"issues":8,"language":"HTML","description":"A demo about agentic worfklows","topics":[],"score":2984},{"name":"Mossaka/spinkube-azure","owner":"Mossaka","html_url":"https://github.com/Mossaka/spinkube-azure","stars":4,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2984},{"name":"scs805/goji-berry-shantungosaurus","owner":"scs805","html_url":"https://github.com/scs805/goji-berry-shantungosaurus","stars":4,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"This project is built in py tool that django-admin startproject my-project.","topics":[],"score":2984},{"name":"aman-17/MediSOAP","owner":"aman-17","html_url":"https://github.com/aman-17/MediSOAP","stars":4,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"FineTuning LLMs on conversational medical dataset.","topics":["fine-tuning","generative-ai","llama","llama-2","llm-training","lora","medical","peft","peft-fine-tuning-llm","qlora","summarization"],"score":2984},{"name":"sayaliwalke30/OnlineFoodOrderDatabase","owner":"sayaliwalke30","html_url":"https://github.com/sayaliwalke30/OnlineFoodOrderDatabase","stars":3,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"TSQL","description":"ERD Creation, SQL database implementation, Encryption, Computed columns, SQL functions, PowerBI reports","topics":["dataanalysis","database-design","erdiagram","sql-server"],"score":2984},{"name":"aenyeart/Portfolio-Website","owner":"aenyeart","html_url":"https://github.com/aenyeart/Portfolio-Website","stars":2,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Repo for my portfolio website using HTML and CSS","topics":[],"score":2984},{"name":"justinvp/templates-aws","owner":"justinvp","html_url":"https://github.com/justinvp/templates-aws","stars":2,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"C#","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2984},{"name":"rynhndrcksn/rynhndrcksn","owner":"rynhndrcksn","html_url":"https://github.com/rynhndrcksn/rynhndrcksn","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"My personal readme","topics":[],"score":2984},{"name":"h-griffin/solo-projects","owner":"h-griffin","html_url":"https://github.com/h-griffin/solo-projects","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":1,"language":"CSS","description":"test practice and miscellaneous solo projects","topics":["css","html","javascript","php"],"score":2984},{"name":"ashblue/unity-simple-singleton","owner":"ashblue","html_url":"https://github.com/ashblue/unity-simple-singleton","stars":7,"forks":0,"issues":12,"language":"C#","description":"An easy to use singleton class for Unity3d projects.
