The WebDAV server can serve any type of hierarchical data, not only files. It supports transparent compression, partial transfers, partial updates, locking, editing, dead properties, strong typing of WebDAV properties, request preconditions, and other features. Setting up a simple WebDAV server to serve some files only requires adding some lines to your web.config file; no code needs to be written. If you want to serve another type of data over WebDAV, it is fairly easy to implement new service providers.","score":3501},{"name":"tunz/chow","owner":"tunz","html_url":"https://github.com/tunz/chow","stars":11,"forks":3,"issues":0,"language":"Haskell","description":"Static Analysis Checker with Micro Grammar","score":3501},{"name":"delhatch/IIR_EQ","owner":"delhatch","html_url":"https://github.com/delhatch/IIR_EQ","stars":9,"forks":5,"issues":0,"language":"VHDL","description":"IIR audio filter in Verilog, running on Zedboard.
