C# weather application is designed so that users can input a city that they would like to check weather details on. The weather data for this program is retrieved by utilizing a free RESTful API service found on openweathermap.org As a result of the query sent to the API with a specific city name and an app_id, a JSON file is returned containing the weather details on the chosen city. To make sense of the data, de-serialization is made to turn the contents of the JSON file to meaningful C# objects. After deserializing the JSON file, useful weather information is gathered by calling the states in of RootObject. Then, the weather details get printed via using the console.","score":2114},{"name":"vivienfay/Airbnb-Seattle-Rental-Price-Prediction","owner":"vivienfay","html_url":"https://github.com/vivienfay/Airbnb-Seattle-Rental-Price-Prediction","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"score":2114},{"name":"eblouin876/Responsive-Portfolio","owner":"eblouin876","html_url":"https://github.com/eblouin876/Responsive-Portfolio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2114},{"name":"eblouin876/Bootstrap-Portfolio","owner":"eblouin876","html_url":"https://github.com/eblouin876/Bootstrap-Portfolio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2114},{"name":"eblouin876/eblouin876.github.io","owner":"eblouin876","html_url":"https://github.com/eblouin876/eblouin876.github.io","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2114},{"name":"eblouin876/Basic-Portfolio","owner":"eblouin876","html_url":"https://github.com/eblouin876/Basic-Portfolio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2114},{"name":"jho323/NCOMMS-24-17835B","owner":"jho323","html_url":"https://github.com/jho323/NCOMMS-24-17835B","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"MATLAB","description":"Software routines utilized for data analysis for Nature Communications Manuscript (NCOMMS-24-17835B)","score":2114},{"name":"meenurajapandian/meenurajapandian.github.io","owner":"meenurajapandian","html_url":"https://github.com/meenurajapandian/meenurajapandian.github.io","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"SCSS","description":"Personal Website","score":2114},{"name":"Glacian22/Basic-Portfolio","owner":"Glacian22","html_url":"https://github.com/Glacian22/Basic-Portfolio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2114},{"name":"Glacian22/Demo","owner":"Glacian22","html_url":"https://github.com/Glacian22/Demo","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"First repo EVAH","score":2114},{"name":"madeline-stevens/yinboostraptest","owner":"madeline-stevens","html_url":"https://github.com/madeline-stevens/yinboostraptest","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"score":2114},{"name":"magarman/learn-co-sandbox","owner":"magarman","html_url":"https://github.com/magarman/learn-co-sandbox","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"score":2114},{"name":"Madhusudhan441/cmpe255-spring19-lab4","owner":"Madhusudhan441","html_url":"https://github.com/Madhusudhan441/cmpe255-spring19-lab4","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":"lab4","score":2114}]
