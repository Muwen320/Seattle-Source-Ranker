The weather data for this program is retrieved by utilizing a free RESTful API service found on openweathermap.org As a result of the query sent to the API with a specific city name and an app_id, a JSON file is returned containing the weather details on the chosen city. To make sense of the data, de-serialization is made to turn the contents of the JSON file to meaningful C# objects. After deserializing the JSON file, useful weather information is gathered by calling the states in of RootObject. Then, the weather details get printed via using the console.","topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"bearpaw/docker","owner":"bearpaw","html_url":"https://github.com/bearpaw/docker","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Dockerfile","description":"my dockers","topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"rfanfant/rfanfant.github.io","owner":"rfanfant","html_url":"https://github.com/rfanfant/rfanfant.github.io","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"rfanfant/HW-Wireframe","owner":"rfanfant","html_url":"https://github.com/rfanfant/HW-Wireframe","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":"Initial Wireframe Project","topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"rfanfant/Basic-Portfolio","owner":"rfanfant","html_url":"https://github.com/rfanfant/Basic-Portfolio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Initial HTML page","topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"anuramubc/Math-Projects","owner":"anuramubc","html_url":"https://github.com/anuramubc/Math-Projects","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Codes for advanced mathematical operations","topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"kennethdsheridan/About","owner":"kennethdsheridan","html_url":"https://github.com/kennethdsheridan/About","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"colinclement/advent","owner":"colinclement","html_url":"https://github.com/colinclement/advent","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Nim","description":"Advent of Code","topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"Kemet2016/My_resume","owner":"Kemet2016","html_url":"https://github.com/Kemet2016/My_resume","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"LuisaSanto/Quizzler-ios","owner":"LuisaSanto","html_url":"https://github.com/LuisaSanto/Quizzler-ios","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Objective-C","description":"Quizz iOS App","topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"jeremytieman/jeremytieman.github.io","owner":"jeremytieman","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremytieman/jeremytieman.github.io","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"CSS","description":"Personal website","topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"jeremytieman/neuralnetwork-old","owner":"jeremytieman","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremytieman/neuralnetwork-old","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Reference implementation of a neural network","topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"jeremytieman/console","owner":"jeremytieman","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremytieman/console","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"Console for text-based video games","topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"ahegashira/itc134-wn19-unix-practice-2","owner":"ahegashira","html_url":"https://github.com/ahegashira/itc134-wn19-unix-practice-2","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":null,"topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"darshanmehta17/acupuncture_analysis","owner":"darshanmehta17","html_url":"https://github.com/darshanmehta17/acupuncture_analysis","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":null,"description":"DATA 557 Final Project","topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"sgravrock/jasmine-studio","owner":"sgravrock","html_url":"https://github.com/sgravrock/jasmine-studio","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Objective-C","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"Cool-Coder174/FP_EE234","owner":"Cool-Coder174","html_url":"https://github.com/Cool-Coder174/FP_EE234","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Assembly","description":"Final for EE234 for spring 2025","topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"jinc132/Group-Lab-3","owner":"jinc132","html_url":"https://github.com/jinc132/Group-Lab-3","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Jupyter Notebook","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"Asterika/vue-project-app","owner":"Asterika","html_url":"https://github.com/Asterika/vue-project-app","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2113},{"name":"Asterika/vue-todo-app","owner":"Asterika","html_url":"https://github.com/Asterika/vue-todo-app","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Vue","description":"An event posting app in a \"to do\" list format.
