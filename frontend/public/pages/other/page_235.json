Notebook","description":"The challenge is to build a face recognition and verificaiton based entry system for a house which hosts some people frequently.  The notebook presents a face recognition system. Tthe ideas presented here are from FaceNetand DeepFace.  Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories:  Face Verification - \"is this the claimed person?\". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. Face Recognition - \"who is this person?\". For example, the video lecture showed a face recognition video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem.","topics":[],"score":2917},{"name":"ProjectSidewalk/Instructions","owner":"ProjectSidewalk","html_url":"https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/Instructions","stars":3,"forks":7,"issues":4,"language":"Shell","description":"Instructions
