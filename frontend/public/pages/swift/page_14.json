In this project we\u2019re going to build iExpense, which is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs. At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent), but in order to accomplish those two things you\u2019re going to need to learn how to:  Present and dismiss a second screen of data. Delete rows from a list Save and load user data \u2026and more.  There\u2019s lots to do, so let\u2019s get started: create a new iOS app using the Single View App template, naming it \u201ciExpense\u201d.
