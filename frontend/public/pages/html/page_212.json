User can give their password as a  set of points as well as multiple lines satisfying the constraints (i.e. intersections).Later during the login process once the user logins with appropriate username and password, the process is success otherwise 2-3 attempts is given to correct his/her passwords for login.","topics":["authentication","client","css","graphical-models","html","java","javascript","pass-go","project","server","standalone"],"score":2299,"global_rank":134428},{"name":"vishgoki/resume","owner":"vishgoki","html_url":"https://github.com/vishgoki/resume","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"SDE Resume","topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134439},{"name":"OvertheBrain/QA-bot","owner":"OvertheBrain","html_url":"https://github.com/OvertheBrain/QA-bot","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"the QA-bot project for summer semster","topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134442},{"name":"rocmalone/odin-landing-page","owner":"rocmalone","html_url":"https://github.com/rocmalone/odin-landing-page","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"A landing page completed for The Odin Project","topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134444},{"name":"mistyb01/fe-mentor-notifs","owner":"mistyb01","html_url":"https://github.com/mistyb01/fe-mentor-notifs","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134462},{"name":"SamSKNg/Boostrap-Test","owner":"SamSKNg","html_url":"https://github.com/SamSKNg/Boostrap-Test","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Test website with Bootstrap framework.","topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134475},{"name":"aubreycorsetti/wirefame-exercise","owner":"aubreycorsetti","html_url":"https://github.com/aubreycorsetti/wirefame-exercise","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134494},{"name":"PythonOrC/The-Cloud-Classroom-Web-Req","owner":"PythonOrC","html_url":"https://github.com/PythonOrC/The-Cloud-Classroom-Web-Req","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134501},{"name":"tuho9428/random-quotes","owner":"tuho9428","html_url":"https://github.com/tuho9428/random-quotes","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134505},{"name":"Jasonccfu/prework-study-guide","owner":"Jasonccfu","html_url":"https://github.com/Jasonccfu/prework-study-guide","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":4,"language":"HTML","description":"for bootcamp","topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134516},{"name":"JSilvas/svelte-LikeADream","owner":"JSilvas","html_url":"https://github.com/JSilvas/svelte-LikeADream","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Created with StackBlitz \u26a1\ufe0f","topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134539},{"name":"JSilvas/svelte-so-real","owner":"JSilvas","html_url":"https://github.com/JSilvas/svelte-so-real","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"Created with StackBlitz \u26a1\ufe0f","topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134540},{"name":"dchege711/tiger_rides","owner":"dchege711","html_url":"https://github.com/dchege711/tiger_rides","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":1,"language":"HTML","description":"A ride sharing application for ORF 401.","topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134546},{"name":"lechrsty/automating-martins-aquarium","owner":"lechrsty","html_url":"https://github.com/lechrsty/automating-martins-aquarium","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134568},{"name":"lechrsty/nss-aquarium","owner":"lechrsty","html_url":"https://github.com/lechrsty/nss-aquarium","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":"for martin's fishies!","topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134569},{"name":"abdisati/Counter-Program","owner":"abdisati","html_url":"https://github.com/abdisati/Counter-Program","stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"language":"HTML","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2299,"global_rank":134581}]
