Approach:  The best ratio is discovered by trying ratios between 50:50 to 85:15. Build an ensemble model based on the optimum ratio selected. This is done my creating ensemble of trees using the optimum ratio, fitting a model to each, making classification probability predictions for each and then averaging those to get predicted classification probabilities. From that we can calculate the loss totaled over all the trees.  The base model is a decision tree with a minimum leaf size is 5, and the minimum split size is 5.

The notebook presents a face recognition system. Tthe ideas presented here are from FaceNetand DeepFace.  Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories:  Face Verification - \"is this the claimed person?\". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. Face Recognition - \"who is this person?\". For example, the video lecture showed a face recognition video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem.","topics":[],"score":2916},{"name":"vasukumar92/Trigger-Word-Detection-for-a-Laptop-using-Deep-Learning","owner":"vasukumar92","html_url":"https://github.com/vasukumar92/Trigger-Word-Detection-for-a-Laptop-using-Deep-Learning","stars":4,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"In this notebook, we will construct a speech dataset and implement an algorithm for trigger word detection (sometimes also called keyword detection, or wakeword detection).

For this exercise, our trigger word will be \"Activate.\" Every time it hears you say \"activate,\" it will make a \"chiming\" sound.

In our version, of 100DaysOfCode, you need to do anything that helps you enhance your tech stack i.e. competitive coding, try learning a new language, read technical articles/ books, make open source contributions, add features to a personal project, etc.  It's okay if you are not able to submit a pull request someday, you can resume it the next day, you will still be in the competition. Remember, life is not a sprint but a marathon, so is the path to learning and growning.  Keep defining your short term goals (measurable) and strive hard to achieve them. (Eg. Getting better at competitive coding is not a measurable goal but achiving 2000 rating in Codechef is measurable)  Update everyday progress and submit a pull request.  (Optional) Follow 100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag and timely tweet your progress with #100DaysOfCode hashtag.  Try to add detailed description of what you did, add corresponding links, if you solve questions, you can add your codes in the same folder and provid a link in the README (not for active contests).  We start the marathon on January 1, 2020. feel free to add your goals beforehand (they can also be added later).  Benefits Coding will become a daily habit for you.  Every day that you consistently code, you\u2019ll build momentum. That momentum will make it easier for you to learn more advanced topics.  The projects that you\u2019ll build will be small in scope, so by the time you finish, you\u2019ll have completed several of them \u2014 and gained a wide range of experience.  Your GitHub profile will look extremely active. And yes, hiring managers and recruiters do look at these.  You\u2019ll get more comfortable contributing in open soruce. It will become a natural, ordinary thing to do.  You\u2019ll have a pretty good reason to stop procrastinating and start coding every day.  Increase your efficiency by checking your daily progress and analysing it.  Compare your progress with others and surpass your limits in learning each day.  Recognition You will be provided with certificates on successful completiton of 100DaysOfCode. At the end of each month, goodies will be given to the top performers. A big surprise for the overall top performers in 100DaysOfCode. Note: Only the students in MNIT/ IIIT Kota/ NIT UK are elligible for prizes/ certificates.  Pre-requisites Markdown: You need to update your README in Markdown (a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax). No need to learn it you can always refer to the guide or use an online markdown editor.  Basic git Basic knowledge of git and its workflow is a must. If you are not comfortable, feel free to ask for help.  How to participate Fork the repository. In your fork, make a folder by the name of your github account.

This assignment was about implementing a simplified version of Dynamo. (And you might argue that it\u2019s not Dynamo any more ;-) There were three main pieces I had to implement: 1) Partitioning, 2) Replication, and 3) Failure handling.  The main goal was to provide both availability and linearizability at the same time. In other words, the implementation should always perform read and write operations successfully even under failures. At the same time, a read operation should always return the most recent value. We had freedom to come up with our own design as long as we were able to provide availability and linearizability at the same time (that is, to the extent that the tester can test). The exception was partitioning and replication, which should be done exactly the way Dynamo does.","topics":[],"score":2128},{"name":"Venkteshkavi/Algorithms-DataStructures-Efficient-Practices","owner":"Venkteshkavi","html_url":"https://github.com/Venkteshkavi/Algorithms-DataStructures-Efficient-Practices","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Java","description":"This repository contains some interesting leetcode and programming problems","topics":[],"score":2128},{"name":"Venkteshkavi/Reinforcement-Learning-Tom-and-Jerry-Game","owner":"Venkteshkavi","html_url":"https://github.com/Venkteshkavi/Reinforcement-Learning-Tom-and-Jerry-Game","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"A project on reinforcement learning using DQN ","topics":[],"score":2106},{"name":"Venkteshkavi/MNIST-USPS-Dataset-Ensemble-Voting","owner":"Venkteshkavi","html_url":"https://github.com/Venkteshkavi/MNIST-USPS-Dataset-Ensemble-Voting","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Project includes using MNIST AND USPS Dataset for performing Logistic, SVM, DNN and Random Forest and performing an ensemble voting","topics":[],"score":2106},{"name":"Venkteshkavi/Learning-to-Rank-using-Microsoft-LeToR-Dataset","owner":"Venkteshkavi","html_url":"https://github.com/Venkteshkavi/Learning-to-Rank-using-Microsoft-LeToR-Dataset","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Linear Regression Model Developed using closed form and SGD and compared their performance","topics":[],"score":2106},{"name":"Venkteshkavi/SIFT-Algorithm-Cursor-Detection","owner":"Venkteshkavi","html_url":"https://github.com/Venkteshkavi/SIFT-Algorithm-Cursor-Detection","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Projects include Sobel Edge Detection, SIFT Algorithm and Cursor Detection","topics":[],"score":2106},{"name":"Venkteshkavi/Epipolar-Geometry-K-Means-using-OpenCV","owner":"Venkteshkavi","html_url":"https://github.com/Venkteshkavi/Epipolar-Geometry-K-Means-using-OpenCV","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Projects on Keypoint Detection, Warping, Epipolar Geometry and K-means Algorithm","topics":[],"score":2106},{"name":"Venkteshkavi/Morphological-Image-Processing","owner":"Venkteshkavi","html_url":"https://github.com/Venkteshkavi/Morphological-Image-Processing","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"Projects on Erosion,Dilation,Segmentation and Hough transform (Circle and Line transform)","topics":[],"score":2106},{"name":"Venkteshkavi/Server-Side-Development","owner":"Venkteshkavi","html_url":"https://github.com/Venkteshkavi/Server-Side-Development","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"Server side development using Node.js Express and MongoDB","topics":[],"score":2105},{"name":"Venkteshkavi/Takaval-Advanced-Information-Retreival","owner":"Venkteshkavi","html_url":"https://github.com/Venkteshkavi/Takaval-Advanced-Information-Retreival","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":6,"language":"JavaScript","description":"Designed and developed an end-end web mining system to analyze social unrest in developing countries.Performed topic classification using Naive Bayes classifier and utilized NLP techniques for language processing, summarization and also performed sentimental analysis.","topics":[],"score":2012}],"vatsalpande":[{"name":"vatsalpande/my-good-reads","owner":"vatsalpande","html_url":"https://github.com/vatsalpande/my-good-reads","stars":1,"forks":4,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":null,"topics":[],"score":3151},{"name":"vatsalpande/AngularBareBone","owner":"vatsalpande","html_url":"https://github.com/vatsalpande/AngularBareBone","stars":1,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"Angular Barebone structure based on angular 1.5+ and gulp","topics":[],"score":2188},{"name":"vatsalpande/my-reading-wishlist","owner":"vatsalpande","html_url":"https://github.com/vatsalpande/my-reading-wishlist","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2184},{"name":"vatsalpande/frontend-exercise-starter","owner":"vatsalpande","html_url":"https://github.com/vatsalpande/frontend-exercise-starter","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"JavaScript","description":"Starter repo for a React Listings Manager coding exercise.","topics":[],"score":2150},{"name":"vatsalpande/GitInDepth","owner":"vatsalpande","html_url":"https://github.com/vatsalpande/GitInDepth","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"Git Basics & Some Advanced Features.
