At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent), but in order to accomplish those two things you\u2019re going to need to learn how to:  Present and dismiss a second screen of data.

lenses can be used to control voltage and resistance. Gemstone lenses can be rotated to dial in voltage and resistance for extremely high currents without buring out. Gemstone lenses have very little interference or friction for electron travel and do not get hot. Components in electronics do not burn out because of Current. Components burn out because resistance in their circuits generates fricton in electrons and their pathways.  Volts=Current(amps)*Resistance(Ohms)  Watts/Volts=Current(Amps)  Flux is the ability for a capacitor to pass electrons without the electron coming into contact with another electron or surface friction from the component. Flux is the ability to distort the path of an electron so that it arrives at the other end at a controlled rate. Current resistors create a bottleneck to slow down electron flow. Bottlenecks create pressure, friction, and heat. Gemstone capacitors bend the path of an electron with a lense so that the electrons must follow a longer path to reach their destination. This elongated path also acts as a buffer to contain electrons on this elongated path. This type of resistor acts as a capacitor.  Time crystals:  If a crystal elongates the path of an electron. Time is literally dialated for an electron within this path. An electron could travel for 1 hour in a crystal and from the outside of the crystal we would see it only 1 second after pressing a switch.","topics":[],"score":2758,"global_rank":39496},{"name":"EmeraldCityIT/Space-Travel-Using-Hydrogen-Dichloramine-and-Laundry-Soap","owner":"EmeraldCityIT","html_url":"https://github.com/EmeraldCityIT/Space-Travel-Using-Hydrogen-Dichloramine-and-Laundry-Soap","stars":1,"forks":2,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"Technology in managing pressure is required for this to exist.

Creating two double latch gates in a series will allow transfer of physical matter from the first buffer to the second buffer. Large coils can be built like tunnels or delivery tubes to feed physical objects from one side, and retrieve physical objects from the opposite side. In physics and chemistry, it is known that a physical change to a substance does not create a chemical change. Creating a physical break in a crystal lattice structure will leave chemical bonds between both parts. Physical breakage of a conductive metal such as aluminum will leave two parts which have been physically broken but retain all chemical bonds between both parts which existed before the structure was broken. In a conductive lattice structure, electrons and signals will continue to transfer between fragments. A coil with two double latch gates in series, which is physically broken between the series, will retain the ability to transfer buffers between the series. The first buffer is transfered via chemical signalling between the two segments. One end of the severed coil can be shipped to remote locations to deliver personell, deliverables, fuel, electricity, etc. The remote transfer gates work as escape hatches on submarines, aircraft, space missions, etc. Power from wind and hydro can be transferred to vessels and batteries to replace nuclear power, tritium, and Pycnogonida.","topics":[],"score":2417,"global_rank":83452},{"name":"EmeraldCityIT/Conversion-of-biomass-into-electricity-and-synthetic-reproduction-thereof","owner":"EmeraldCityIT","html_url":"https://github.com/EmeraldCityIT/Conversion-of-biomass-into-electricity-and-synthetic-reproduction-thereof","stars":0,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"The human body breaks down food into molecules and electrolytes which become refined and processed into grey matter within the brain.
