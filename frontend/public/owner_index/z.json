In this post, we provide a gentle introduction to knowledge graphs and explain how one clever GNN model achieved state-of-the-art results by approaching the embedding space in a novel way.","topics":[],"score":2220,"global_rank":161905},{"name":"Zahra-Bakhtiari/Numpy_Tutorial","owner":"Zahra-Bakhtiari","html_url":"https://github.com/Zahra-Bakhtiari/Numpy_Tutorial","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":null,"topics":["broadcasting","numpy","numpy-arrays","vectorization"],"score":2219,"global_rank":162530},{"name":"Zahra-Bakhtiari/Covid19-QA-NLP","owner":"Zahra-Bakhtiari","html_url":"https://github.com/Zahra-Bakhtiari/Covid19-QA-NLP","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2197,"global_rank":180638},{"name":"Zahra-Bakhtiari/Microsoft-Vision-Classifier","owner":"Zahra-Bakhtiari","html_url":"https://github.com/Zahra-Bakhtiari/Microsoft-Vision-Classifier","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":null,"topics":[],"score":2182,"global_rank":216034},{"name":"Zahra-Bakhtiari/Predictive-Wavelength-Switching","owner":"Zahra-Bakhtiari","html_url":"https://github.com/Zahra-Bakhtiari/Predictive-Wavelength-Switching","stars":0,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":null,"topics":[],"score":1866,"global_rank":399623}],"zdong1":[{"name":"zdong1/API-Crime-Mapping","owner":"zdong1","html_url":"https://github.com/zdong1/API-Crime-Mapping","stars":7,"forks":4,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"A R Program to do some spatial statistics","topics":["crime","spatial-statistics"],"score":3176,"global_rank":20446},{"name":"zdong1/differential_privacy","owner":"zdong1","html_url":"https://github.com/zdong1/differential_privacy","stars":2,"forks":1,"issues":2,"language":"Python","description":"Experimentations for Supervised Privacy Auditing","topics":["differential-privacy","privacy-audit"],"score":2967,"global_rank":27696},{"name":"zdong1/CDC","owner":"zdong1","html_url":"https://github.com/zdong1/CDC","stars":5,"forks":0,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"Swiss CDC Project Repository: Analyze and Predict human mobility patterns using kernel density ranking methods, and analyze the spatial-temporal trends of the activity spaces of human beings.","topics":["cell-phone","data-mining","gps","machine-learning","trajectory-inference"],"score":2713,"global_rank":43192}],"Ziyal":[{"name":"Ziyal/BlogDashboard","owner":"Ziyal","html_url":"https://github.com/Ziyal/BlogDashboard","stars":6,"forks":5,"issues":0,"language":"Other","description":"This is a web app that focuses on a user dashboard where users can updated their profile and admins can create, modify, and delete users.
