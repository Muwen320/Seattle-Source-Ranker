If you have ever saved a field map file (sdl file) from Data Loader then automation is probably a good option.       Common tasks that are ideal for Data Import Automation are donation records coming from periodic financial reports, business cards/contacts from marketing events, external databases not integrated into Salesforce, or any other data that has the same fields you are regularly uploading.     There is an investment in setting up the Data Import Automation that takes a couple of hours but once you have it setup the end user experience is     Copy external data sources (e.g., csv, excel files) to a specific location Run the import automation program Review import emails (takes about 10-15 minutes for import to finish) which have a log of the import process and the Salesforce Data Loader success and error files are attached.    501 Commons Salesforce Importer  Open Source project on GitHub  https://github.com/501Commons/Salesforce-Importer     The technology used is   Salesforce Data Loader Command Line Microsoft Excel Python The bulk of the setup work is building the Microsoft Excel file by adding New Data Queries for your external sources & Salesforce Object query.  Then using Excel Power Query merge data between your external data sources and Salesforce objects so that you have a list of data to insert (not already in Salesforce) and data to update.     The project is open source so feel free to suggest and make contributions.  Built and tested on Windows but no reason shouldn't work on Mac
