We wanted to implement this idea to Classrooms and emphasise on the Smart Attendance System. We wrote the code in Python and we used techniques such as Haar-Cascading to detect the trained object (face).  There are 3 steps involved: Training, Testing and Prediction. A persons image will be captured in different light intensities and pose. These images are stored in the database. This is training. When the person faces the camera, his/her images will be verified with that of the trained images in the database. This is testing. The final step is the prediction, which tells us if it is a success ( when there is a match between the image captured and the images in the database) or a failure ( when there is no match between the image captured and the images in the database).","topics":[],"score":2993},{"name":"nanjeshramesh/NVIDIA-Deep-Learning","owner":"nanjeshramesh","html_url":"https://github.com/nanjeshramesh/NVIDIA-Deep-Learning","stars":2,"forks":1,"issues":0,"language":"Python","description":"The NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) offers hands-on training in AI and accelerated computing to solve real-world problems.

The barber shop has one barber, one barber chair, and n chairs for waiting customers, if any, to sit on. If there are no customers present, the barber sits down in the barber chair and falls asleep. When a customer arrives and the barber is sleeping, s/he has to wake up the sleeping barber. If additional customers arrive while the barber is cutting a customer\u2019s hair, they either sit down (if there are empty chairs) or wait for the empty chairs (if all chairs are full). The problem is to program the barber and the customers without getting into race conditions. Your program must prompt user for the number of customers and the number of chairs in the waiting room.
